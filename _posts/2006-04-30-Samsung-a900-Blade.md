I have a new phone, the Samsung A900, or Blade.  

Actually, the phone is great.  I've had her about 5 months.  At first she was buggy with sluggish menus and needing to be reset everytime I wanted to use picturemail, but a few firmware updates later and she purrs.  Using Opera's browser (the built-in one sucks), I can browse my favorite sites and check (and reply) to my gmail.  The megapixel camera is good for taking printable portraits and still-lifes, but being camphone, don't hope for anything in motion or wining any contests.  She can connect to your computer using USB or bluetooth and you can put (and use) almost any files on her that way, including mp3 and pdf.  This also means you can create your own ringtones without paying the companies their extortion fees.  She comes with bluetooth that is fully functional, except for A2DP.  You can even program her to type text messages as you talk to her: voice-to-text.  I use her for flickr, blogging and surfing the internet, especially during long, boring medical lectures.

Stats:

* Dimensions: 3.9" x 2.6" x 0.6"
* Weight: 3.53 oz.
* Continuous digital CDMA talk time: Up to 3.0 hours.
* Main Display: 240 x 320 pixel 262K TFT color display
* External Display 96 x 96 pixel 65K TFT display
