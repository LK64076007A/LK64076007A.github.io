[New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/world/asia/30japan.html):

> This mountain village near the Sea of Japan, withered to eight aging residents, concluded recently that it could no longer go on.
> 
> So, after months of anguish, the villagers settled on a drastic solution: selling all of Ogama to an industrial waste company from Tokyo, which will turn it into a landfill.
> 
> With the proceeds, the villagers, mainly in their 70's, plan to pack up everything, including their family graves, and move in the next few years to yet uncertain destinations, likely becoming the first community in Japan to voluntarily cease to exist.
