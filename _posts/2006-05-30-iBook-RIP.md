My iBook first died a few months ago.  The screen stopped working and I figured it was DOA.  I finally decided to take it into a repair shop today.  They can fix it but it will cost $500USD.  Thus it is going to remain dead.  I could buy a new Gateway laptop with much better specs for $150 more.  As much as I love my macs this poor doc can't afford that kind of expense.

Excuse me.  I need a moment to mourn.
