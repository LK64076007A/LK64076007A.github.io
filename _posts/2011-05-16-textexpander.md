I’ve been wanting TextExpander for awhile and was going to buy it when I got around to it.

For the next 15 days it’s being [sold in a bundle][1] with 7 other Mac apps for five dollars less than it’s normal price ($30). You also get a bunch of other great productivity and social apps like Keyboard Maestro. 

If you want to be a power user, or you have to because you use computers for a living, i.e. physician, than you need good macro programs.

Don’t know why? Make all your disease information, frequent prescriptions and operative notes/instructions into macros. It’s a lot easier to type OA and have all my osteoarthritis information pop up than to type it fresh each time or even copy and paste it.
