> Since there is no evidence of physician technophobia in any other areas of medicine (or private life) and since there is no measurable benefit to doctors in keeping their patients in a subservient position, the question then becomes: who is benefiting from EHRs?

The simplest answer is usually the best.

Who benefits from the current offering of EMRS?

1. Those who sell EMRs.
2. Those who mine the data from these EMRs.

Why don't physicians adopt them without being forced?

1. They are slow.
2. They don't improve quality.

Don't misunderstand. I would gladly use a quality product. There just isn't any. As soon as there's an Apple-quality EMR, I'll be the first in line to buy it.

Frankly, the EMR development community has failed us. Perhaps all the good developers are working for Facebook because that's were the money is.
