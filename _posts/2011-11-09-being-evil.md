Google is really starting to piss me off. I don't know if they're evil or incompetent, but it's getting ridiculous. Today's example is prototypical.


I go to a webpage with a YouTube (Google) video embeded:

I click the play button and I get treated to this:

![BeingEvil2](/images/BeingEvil2.jpg)

When I click through the link to see the supported browsers, it does claim that what I'm running, stock Safari, is supported. Um, so why is it claiming I can't see the video when I know it is fully HTML5 compliant?

So I go into the Safari developer menu and trigger the browser to tell the website that I'm on an iPad rather than my Macbook Air:

I'm still on the same computer, with the same browser, in the same window even. The window reloads and the video starts to play:

This is fucking ridiculous. 

Google needs to get its head out of its ass. I used to be an all Google guy but the number of their products I use is rapidly disappearing.
