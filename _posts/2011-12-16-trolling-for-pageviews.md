> Philip, from London, told me how he felt when he first became aware of his status (as having been circumcised) as a small child:

> "I wanted it covered up.  I felt mutilated.  I also felt that my parents had abandoned me; why had they let someone do that to me? I had such a feeling of helplessness and abuse due to my circumcision."

Clearly, Philip of London's doctor confused castration with circumcision as the complete lack of testes is the only explanation for an XY human of any age to act so pathetically over something so insignificant. This goes double for the author of this article.
