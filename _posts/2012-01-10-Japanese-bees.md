Japanese giant hornets can massacre a European honey bee hive with 30 hornets completely destroying the 30,000 bees and the hive in a few short hours. The slaughter is brutal. The brave bees fly uselessly to their death.

Japanese honey bees have a defense. Just as brave, but more effective. Working as a team, they have a way to stop the brutal invaders.

This is absolutely amazing. 

Moral of the story: The Japanese are deadly.
