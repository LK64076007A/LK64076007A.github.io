I opted out of cable television a long time ago, primarily for the cost, but you forget about the other benefits until you are suddenly subjected to the barage of loud commercials interupting the plot every 5-10 minutes. While those of us who grew up like this may have trouble recognizing how terrible the situation is, kids in their natural state of mine see the situation much more clearly.

> This is just a commercial. I was turning the volume down because it was so loud. Shrek will come back on in a few minutes” I say.

> “Did it break?”, she asks. It does sometimes happen at home that Flash or Silverlight implode, interrupt her show, and I have to fix it.

> “No. It’s just a commercial.”

> “What’s a commercial?”, she asks.

> ...

> I then do what I should have simply done in the first place. I hook up the iPad to the free hotel wifi and hand it to her. She fires up the Netflix app, chooses a show, and she is happy.

> This, she gets. This makes sense.
