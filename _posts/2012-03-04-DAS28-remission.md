Sadly, no. Patient's in DAS28 remission continue to have ongoing joint damage if they still have swollen joints.

Other interesting side points:

- 15% of patients on methotrexate monotherapy achieve DAS28 remission
- Joint damage is related to acute-phase response and swollen joint counts
- Joint damage is not related to tender joint counts
