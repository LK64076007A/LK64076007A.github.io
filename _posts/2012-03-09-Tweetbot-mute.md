I just figured out the Tweetbot mute feature. It's so easy to use yet very granular and powerful. 

Someone you like getting too chatty after having a bit too much to drink? Mute them for 6 hours. 

Don't want to see every post from the South by Southwest conference? Mute the hashtag #sxsw for the next week.
