[Frederick Wolfe](http://www.acpinternist.org/archives/2009/05/fibromyalgia.htm):

> Fibromyalgia is a socially constructed illness. It represents a common set of symptoms that all human beings have.

> ...

> Very often what people with fibromyalgia need are friends, people who can talk with them. They need somebody to be there for them. What one has to do is approach fibromyalgia patients with wisdom and kindness.â€¦
