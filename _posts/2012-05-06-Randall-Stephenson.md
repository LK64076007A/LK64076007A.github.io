[New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/att-randall-stephenson/):

> Randall Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive said that he wished the company had never offered an unlimited data plan for the device and that he loses sleep over free texting services like Apple’s iMessage.

> “If you’re using iMessage, you’re not using one of our messaging services, right? That’s disruptive to our messaging revenue stream.”

What a scumbag. There's not really a carrier I like, but I think Sprint is up next for me. At least their CEO doesn't seem to be a dick and they still have unlimited data.
