A short video demonstrating using Keyboard Maestro to write prednisone tapers in a patient friendly format, calculating out the total number of pills needed at the end.

**Update**: The first taper doesn't actually calculate the corrects number of pills in the video. I had made a mistake in the order of a loop. It's been fixed since this video.
