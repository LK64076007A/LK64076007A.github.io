[The Brief][121106144959]:

> Huawei Probably Not Spying, Just Crappy Programmers
> 
> A person familiar with the White House’s review said they found equipment that was “riddled” with vulnerabilities caused by poor programming, and other experts familiar with their equipment told Reuters that it’s “five times easier” to find a vulnerability in a Huawei router than it is in a Cisco one. 

Never attribute to malice that which is more likely due to incompetence.
