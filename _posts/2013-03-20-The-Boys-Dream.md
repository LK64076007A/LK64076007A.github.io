Boy:

> I had a weird dream last night. There were zombies all over the world in the United States and Japan.[^1363777982-fn1] The humans had barriers to protect them and keep the zombies out, but zombie scientists[^1363777982-fn4] made a spray that could bring dead things back to life as zombies. They sprayed it on triceratops[^1363777982-fn2] and the zombie triceratops broke through the barriers so we had to make new defenses. The spray could also turn humans to zombies.

"Were you scared?"

> No.[^1363777982-fn3] 

[^1363777982-fn1]: I love how the whole world consists of two countries. 

[^1363777982-fn2]: Zombies and dinosaurs? Excellent crossover. 

[^1363777982-fn3]: He acted insulted that I even asked.

[^1363777982-fn4]: Say what?!
