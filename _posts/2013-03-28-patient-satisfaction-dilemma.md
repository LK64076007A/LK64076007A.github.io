[Zac at Agraphia](http://www.agraphia.net/the-patient-satisfaction-dilemma/):

> With a click of a button I can easily do all these things, even when I know I shouldn't.  And I'll get paid more.  And I'll avoid lawsuits.  And my patient interactions will be far more pleasant.  I suppose in the end, I try to do the right thing instead of the easy thing because I firmly believe that my duty is to take care of my patients.

There is no way around the fact that there will always be some amount of paternalism in medicine because there will always be a significant knowledge gap between the physician and the patient. 

When "satisfaction" is taken to the extreme as a marker of quality and when "making the customer happy" becomes the primary rule in a clinic, good physicians will suffer great psychological pressure and patients will be at risk. 

I think the ER is the place where we will see the worst consequences of this mandate.
