My dad told me a story as a kid about a good medicine that used to exist for morning sickness until some greedy nurse had a baby with birth defects and sued the company. They lost and the drug wasn't profitable enough for them to continue making it in the face of potential future lawsuits and the precedence of that loss. They stopped making the drug. Sometimes, my dad would have the drug (really just a couple of over-the-counter pills) made up specially for certain patients. 

At least that's how I remember the story. 

From this I learned several lessons:

1. The legal system is not about justice. 
1. The people closest to the medical system are the ones who abuse it the most. 
1. Sometimes you have to take great risks to do the right thing. 
1. The good guy doesn't always win. 

Looks like the drug is coming back:

> U.S. doctors have had no officially approved treatment for morning sickness since lawsuits forced Bendectin off the market in 1983. But the drug's main ingredients are vitamin B6 and an over-the-counter antihistamine, and obstetricians often advised pregnant women how to mix up the right dose themselves.

> U.S. health regulators have approved a drug to treat morning sickness that was withdrawn from the market 30 years ago amid claims, since debunked, that it caused birth defects.
