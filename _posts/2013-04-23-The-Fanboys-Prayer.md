The Mac is my Shepherd; I shall not defrag.  
He maketh me not change my system fonts.  
He leadeth me to easy back ups.  
He installs no bloatware.  
He leadeth me in the paths of a Unix core for stability's sake.  

Yea, though I walk through the valley of crappy medical forms,  
I will fear no .docx: For PDFpen Pro art with me;  
Thy "create form fields" command, it comforts me.  
Thou preparest a Dropbox folder before me in the presence of all my devices;  
Thou annointest my terminal with bash; My stack doesn't overflow.  

Surely TextExpander and Keyboard Maestro shall power all the shortcuts of my workflow,  
and I will compute in the House of the Mac forever.
