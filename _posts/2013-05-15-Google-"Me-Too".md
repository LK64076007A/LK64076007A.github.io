[John Gruber][daringfireball]:

> Google is the company that built Android after the iPhone, Google Plus after Facebook, and now a subscription music service after Spotify. They entered the RSS reader market, wiped it out, and are now just walking away from it.

It is the "walking away" part I need to remember so I don't end up relying too heavily on their services or sink too much time and data into their silos.
