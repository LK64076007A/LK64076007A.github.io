[A man who saved the life of a little boy who was being attacked by 3 pit bulls is being fined $1000 by the D.C.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/man-who-shot-pit-bull-attacking-child-has-charges-deferred/2013/05/20/c8ac3356-c14c-11e2-bfdb-3886a561c1ff_story.html?hpid=z4):

> When the three dogs attacked an 11-year-old boy riding the dirt bike he had gotten for Christmas, neighbor Benjamin Srigley jumped in to help. He retrieved his 9mm Ruger P-90 handgun from his house and fatally shot one the animals. A D.C. police officer shot and killed the other two.
> 
> But the 39-year-old’s actions — deemed heroic by the boy’s relatives — quickly became complicated. Authorities say Srigley had *legally bought the handgun and two other firearms in Virginia*, but he had failed to register them in the District.

> …
> 
> Police confirmed that Srigley has no criminal record in the District or elsewhere.

Shameful.
