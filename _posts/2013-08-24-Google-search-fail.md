Dear Google,

The following sites will show up on the first page when a patient is trying to search for information on a doctor by the syntax Dr. firstname lastname:

1. Google +[^130824082034]
1. Healthgrades.com
1. Vitals.com
1. Wellness.com
1. Betterdoctor.com
1. Ratemds.com
1. Manta.com
1. Doctor.webmd.com
1. Lifescript.com

They are all link-bait, content-farm junk sites. Yes, including your own. 

This is not helpful for users. This is not helpful for the internet. 

Fix it.
