I don't mind, and actually appreciate some, hidden UI features, but I also think basic features should be clearly labeled with intuitive labels that don't suggest the opposite of what I want. 


On the left is the main play screen of iTunes Radio. If you click the star it brings up the menu on the right.

Why on earth would I hit the `star`, a universal symbol for favoriting or liking, when I want to "Never Play This Song"?
