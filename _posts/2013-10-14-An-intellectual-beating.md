[Steven Poole for The Atlantic][newrepublic]:

> In doing so, you might, like him, become incapable of understanding the stories in any other way than through the lens of your prefabricated idea. And so, because your idea is never allowed to be challenged by opposing evidence, it will languish forlornly, like Malcolm Gladwellâ€™s, at the level of vapid homily.

Ouch.
