*I should add your iPhone to the wifi.*

Manager: We don't have wifi.

*Yes, we do.*

Manager: No, we don't pay for that.

*The first thing I did when I started working here was install wifi.*

Manager: But that costs a lot of money.

*No. It was free.*

Manager: They told me it costs $50 a month!

*Who told you that?*

Manager: The internet company. We were going to have wifi for the customers, but that seemed like too much money.

*Well, you can pay me $50 a month if you want, but it's not costing me anything.*

Manager: So, you can install wifi for the customers?

*Sure. First thing in the morning. I have an extra Airport Express laying around the house somewhere.*
