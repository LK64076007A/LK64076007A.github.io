I ordered the [Tile](https://www.thetileapp.com/), a BTLE internet-enabled device designed to help you find lost items, to attach to my keys so I can avoid the occasional panic on Monday morning when I can't find them. 

After waiting a ridiculously long time to arrive, it was unresponsive out of the box. I followed all the trouble shooting ideas on their website without success. I emailed support and have gotten no reply.
