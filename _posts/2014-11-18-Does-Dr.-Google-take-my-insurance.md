A secretary walks up to my nurse and starts complaining about a minor symptom. My nurse gives her excellent advice. The secretary expresses doubt and starts to argue. I interject that the advice is excellent and should be tried. The secretary counters that she had done a Google search. 

Having become accustomed to this response from patients and family alike, the board certified physician and license nurse both shrug and go back to work.
