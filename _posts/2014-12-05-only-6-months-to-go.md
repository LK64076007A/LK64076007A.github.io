_Do you have any questions about the new baby?_

Boy (age 8): No!

_Are you annoyed about something?_

Boy: I'm annoyed you keep asking.

_I just want to make sure you're comfortable with everything._

Boy: I'm not comfortable with **anything**.

_What aren't you comfortable with?_

Boy: It's been three months and we don't have a name or a room for the baby.
