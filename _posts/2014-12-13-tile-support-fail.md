I was looking forward to [the Tile](https://www.thetileapp.com/). 

Sadly, it was [dead on arrival]({% post_url 2014-11-13-The-Tile--Dead-on-Arrival %}).

I went to their website and did all the trouble shooting activities they recommended, and being the "tech guy" in my social circle I tried several other things, all to no avail. 

I sent several requests for help to them on their website.

They finally replied to me... **16 days later**.

with [the exact same information on the website](https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/202517983-One-of-my-Tiles-will-not-activate) that I'd already done. 

I informed them that this didn't work.

Their response was report the same issue, again, in the app?

This seemed very strange but I thought perhaps there is some extra data that is sent with the in-app report.

They replied 12 days later with a completely different ticket number and "activation tips".

This is ridiculous. I get better service at the DMV.
