From the [New Tech City podcast](http://www.wnyc.org/story/theres-still-something-about-voicemail/):

> Voicemail is a default archive of your life. You would miss it if it were gone

Voice mail is terrible. It's just another form of spam. I hate it. I also hate phone calls. I'd decline to answer a phone call from someone (everyone) I didn't want to talk to, and then I'd immediately have another message from them that I needed to deal with. 

You said "you would miss [voice mail] if it were gone". Wrong. Absolutely wrong. And I know.

A few years ago I was at my carrier's store dealing with something and when they finished they asked if there was anything else they could help me with. Without really thinking, I said "yes, get rid of my voice mail account". She looked shocked, and perhaps a bit concerned about my sanity. She didn't know if it was possible to do but got on the phone with corporate. I myself didn't think it was going to be possible, either because of a technical issue, or just a lack of knowledge from the low level tech support I'm use to getting, but only a few minutes I was told I no longer had a voice mail account. 

It's been amazing. If you call me, my phone will just ring and ring like an old land line. If I decline your call, you get cut off. It is one less inbox I have to check. One less "to do" list cluttering up my already too cluttered life. My life is so much more peaceful.

If only I could get rid of my USPS address.
