With insurance companies determining what treatments are allowed, patients self-diagnosing on Google, and non-practicing surgeons being the most popular source of professional medical advice, I think the only reason physicians still exist is so there is someone to sue when it all falls apart. 

...and to prescribe "medical" marijuana in states that don't have the balls to legalized it completely.
