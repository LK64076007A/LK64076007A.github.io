When you create an alarm in iOS[^20150308234102], it is given the default label `Alarm`. I find it useful to change this for two reasons. First, it reminds me why I set the alarm in the first place. This may not be confusing if the alarm is waking me up in the morning, but I might also set multiple alarms during the day for different tasks. These levels remind me what I need to do next:
 
- `push wash into dryer`
- `check on sump pump progress`
- `verify boy cleaned his room`

This is easily done with Siri: `Set an alarm for 54 minutes labeled 'put wash in the dryer'.`

The other benefit of labeling alarms is that you can edit them by their label using Siri: `Change the alarm labeled 'wake up call' to 530am`.
