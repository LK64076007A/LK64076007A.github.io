I think that dictating on the iPhone is amazing. For example, this was dictated in a crowded bar at 9 PM on Friday evening[^150317144346]. It was really loud in here with the band and all:

For some reason, dictating to the Mac in a quiet office room doesn't work well at all. So if I ever have something I do want to dictate, I will do so on the iPhone and then transfer it.

At the request of others, here is a video of how I do so using the apps [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&at=11l4RT) and  [Commandâ€“C](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/command-c-clipboard-sharing/id692783673?mt=8&at=11l4RT).
