Most of my best ideas and tasks I want/need to accomplish come to my mind when I'm driving or in the shower.[^150713121443] When Siri came along, it made capturing these [notes][imore] or [to do items][imore 2] easy while driving. I still didn't have a way to update [Omnifocus][apple] while in the shower, until I remembered I had an old iPhone 5s and [Lifeproof Nuud waterproof case][amazon]. 

I've moved beyond a [day and night phone][thewire]. It is all about the shower phone now.

I've turned off notifications and cellular radio. When iOS 9 comes out, I'll permanantly put it in [Low Power Mode][lowpower]. 

I guess you could just [use a plastic bag][osxdaily].

[^150713121443]: Probably because it is the only time I'm not actively thinking/doing something else.
