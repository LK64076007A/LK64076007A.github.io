Since before I bought my first sailboat several years ago, I've wanted a [Torqeedo](http://www.torqeedo.com/en/products/outboards/travel)--an elegant, efficient, electric motor. 

The benefits of electric engines on a sailboat are numerous. To begin with, there are already many options for generating electricity on sailboats using wind and solar energy, thus providing a consistently renewable source of energy. Electric engines are much quieter, almost silent compared to a combustion engine. There are none of the pungent orders of gasoline and oil. 

There is however one major drawback that is astounding and is mentioned in the product video for the engine I bought (starts 41 seconds in):

**10 pound lithium battery = 35 grams of gasoline**

Ouch.

Still, I think the advantages outweigh the drawback, and I ordered one today, finally.
