Parker, [The Internet Is Unstable](https://byparker.com/blog/2017/the-internet-is-unstable/), on February 14, 2017:

> Why is it, therefore, that we have built the World Wide Web for a stable & fast Internet connection, rather than the much more common unstable & slow Internet connection?

Too often I see apps fail miserable when on a flaky connection, or worse not work at all with no connection. This is unacceptable. Parker promises to design for the reality not the Silicon Valley dream.
