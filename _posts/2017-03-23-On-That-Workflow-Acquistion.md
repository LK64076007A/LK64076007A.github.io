> I think this is bad news for anyone that relies on Workflow to make iOS useful... I'd love to be wrong on this front, but I don't think automation is a priority for Apple or for iOS.

I agree. The small, abused optimist in my brain hopes this will turn out as successful as Siri or TestFlight, but the pragmatist is afraid my most productive app on iOS is dead. At least they didn't pull it from the store. Yet. And now it's free!
