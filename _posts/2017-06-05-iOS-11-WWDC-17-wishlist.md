**Updated after announcements**

Less bugs (don't expect that to be announced in stage)

Swipe-style keyboard (never going to happen)

Create a new note from the search field in Notes (unlikely)

Location/wifi based system settings (unlikely)
- volume on or off
- VPN on or off

Workflow-esque automation (possible someday) 

Siri for third party notes, to-do, and maps apps (unlikely, possible, never)

**Notes and todos now have Siri-kit support.**

Springboard management options (unlikely)
- offer to delete unused apps **added**
- sort by last used, most used, last updated
