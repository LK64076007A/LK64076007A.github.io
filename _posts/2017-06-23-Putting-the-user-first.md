I turned on the Apple TV to buy Finding Dory in iTunes for my fish-obsessed two-year old to watch. I used Siri voice control of go to the movie, but for a few moments I was confused. Where was the price?

Apple was showing me that the movie I planned to buy from them was free on Netflix, which I also subscribe too. The UI is even designed to try to prevent me from buying something I don't have to; I would have to navigate to a different page if I wanted to purchase. Any other company would have the free option burried and their purchase option big, bold, and pre-selected. As a user and a stockholder, I'm impressed.
