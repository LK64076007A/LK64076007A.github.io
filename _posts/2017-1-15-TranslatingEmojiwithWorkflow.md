Being old[^20170115160457], I often have no idea what the emojis mean that my children, wife, and younger friends send me. A simple [Workflow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4RT) workflow[^20170115160636] translates these for me. It's simple because [Workflow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&uo=4&at=11l4RT) already has an action that translates the emojis. This workflow just takes the clipboard text, strips any non-emoji text[^20170115161100], and displays the text translation of anything remaining. Having the workflow in the widget screen means translation is always 1-2 swipes and a tap away.

[^20170115160457]: Older than 26.

[^20170115160636]: I wish they'd named these differently. TextExpander has snippets and Keyboard Maestro has macros. 

[^20170115161100]: To save time rather than carefully selecting only the emoji.
