Gabe, [When They Say They're Going to Cure Cancer Be Skeptical](http://www.macdrifter.com/2017/02/when-they-say-theyre-going-to-cure-cancer-be-skeptical-link.html), on 2-13-2017.

"Cancer" isn't one thing or disease. Saying you're going to cure it is like saying you're going to cure illness. Either the person saying it isn't smart enough to know this or they think you're not.
