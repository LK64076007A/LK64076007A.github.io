We live at a time like never before where you can learn anything you want from the comfort of your home. For any given topic you can find numerous articles, blog posts, or videos covering that topic from the mundane to the esoteric, and like any healthy academic environment, find diverse opinions on the issue to maximize your understanding of any controversy or nuance. 

When I was a kid in the 90s, I wanted to learn how to pick a lock. There was one book at the library on the subject. It was a 10 minute bike ride to the library from the house. The book was never in stock. Always checked out, or perhaps long since lost. I never found out. I also never learned to pick locks. Now there are hundreds of videos on lockpicking in YouTube. I regularly learn how to do new things, adding to my skills toolbox, using YouTube or other resources. 

Which makes [this article](https://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/the-rise-of-adulting-101-classes-helping-young-people-learning-basic-life-skills) about college kids needing education in basic life skills all the more concerning. There is no reason for someone not to know something due to a lack of access to information. Every single topic they mention is covered in great detail on many free sites. Sadly, I think this is more due to a kind of learned helplessness in which they throw up their hands saying "I don't know how to do that so I never will" rather than "I don't know how to do that, so I'm going to research how". 

I suspect this is a problem with poor parenting. Parents who wanted to be friends rather than disciplinarians. Parents who were too tired to correct and educate. Parents who were too rushed to make the child do it for themselves.
