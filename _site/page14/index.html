      <div class="content"><p>Yesterday, a customer on the Keyboard Maestro forums wrote a thank you to Peter, the owner/developer of KM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Peter, I don’t know how you do it–all the work you do on KM, and still answering many questions in the forum. Just a note from one very appreciative customer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was quickly followed by “+1”s.</p>

<p>I have to agree that this echoes my sentiments too. I love KM as excellent software, but the extra work on answering (sometimes silly or rude questions) is really wonderful.</p>

<p>Even better was Peter’s deferential reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks Mike (and others!), your thoughts are greatly appreciated!</p>

  <p>It’s easy to say how I do it - I’m supported by all of you. I get to do what I love, work from home so I can walk my kids to school, make something that is useful to lots of people, and all because you folks all support me, both financially and by helping expand Keyboard Maestro to others.</p>

  <p>So by far it is me who needs to thank you all, not the other way around!</p>

  <p>Thanks,
Peter.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/The-safety-of-clone-backups/">Clone Backups - Why and How</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>If you have valuable data on your computer you need to have a back up and more than one. Your data is likely priceless, irreplaceable and/or expensive to recover. If you’re anything like me, your data may consist of some of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photos
    <ul>
      <li>Military</li>
      <li>Med school graduation</li>
      <li>Wedding</li>
      <li>Children</li>
      <li>Clinical photos</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Music - entire collection of CDs long burned to digital and thrown away</li>
  <li>Movies
    <ul>
      <li>Home movies</li>
      <li>Hollywood movie rips from old DVDs long thrown away</li>
      <li>Training videos</li>
      <li>Conference talks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documents
    <ul>
      <li>Tax returns</li>
      <li>Business receipts</li>
      <li>Lease agreements</li>
      <li>Scans of all diplomas, licenses, etc.</li>
      <li>All utility bills</li>
      <li>Research papers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should back up the data frequently and redundantly. Hard drives do fail. Natural disasters, both weather and children, do happen. <a href="http://m.nydailynews.com/1.247700#bmb=1">Thieves do take things</a>. <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/">Hackers can wipe out everything</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to make multiple continuous backups with at least some of them stored off site. There are many easy and relatively inexpensive ways to do this, but today I just want to talk about one specific type of back up that I think is the most valuable. (<em>You still should do more than one kind.</em>)</p>

<h3 id="clone-backups">Clone Backups</h3>

<p>A clone backup is an identical copy of your hard drive including the operating system and not just the user data. This is a <em>bootable</em> copy of your computer meaning that if your hard drive wears out, gets stolen, is shot, whatever, you can plug your clone in and run it identically to the machine that just died. To be clear, if my drive dies in the middle of clinic, I pull the clone back up out of my bag, plug it in, reboot, and I’m back in business.</p>

<p>Most other forms of back up just back up user data, or are primarily designed to recover small amount of data at a time. While this is nice to have in the situation of catastrophic failure, it doesn’t do me much good if my hard drive dies in the middle of rounds or at conference before I have to give a presentation.</p>

<p>In those situations, I need <em>my</em> machine. I need a clone.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p><em>This is for Macs only. I’m sure Windows and Linux have their own software for doing this but I don’t use those products so I can’t make recommendations.</em></p>

<p>There are two excellent and easy to use programs that will make clone back ups for you: <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> and <a href="http://www.bombich.com">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>. They are both excellent and are staples of Mac nerds. I happen to use SuperDuper! but not for any particular reason. They are not available in the Mac App Store because they need very low level access to your computer to make the clone, which is not allowed for MAS apps. I’m always happily surprised when I go to upgrade my OS and their software is already upgraded for the new version.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p><em>The hardware is platform agnostic so you can use these on Mac, Windows, or Linux.</em></p>

<p>The other thing you’ll need to make a clone back up is a hard drive. At the bare minimum it needs to be big enough to hold your entire primary hard drive. In addition, I recommend that it be small so that you can carry it with you all the time, and have the fastest port possible for your machine so that the back ups are quick to make. The longer it takes to run, the less likely you are to do it. (<em>Think compliance with QID dosing versus QD dosing.</em>)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Larger than the drive it is cloning</li>
  <li>Small so it is portable</li>
  <li>Fast connection so backups are easier</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to speed there are two types of drives and two major types of connections: SSD vs HDD, and Thunderbolt vs USB 3.0.</p>

<p>SSDs (solid state drives) are newer, faster, and have no moving parts. They are the Ferrari of drives. They also cost as much. HDDs (hard disk drive) are the classic spinning disk drives. They are larger, store more, and are cheaper, but are also slower.</p>

<p>The Thunderbolt connection is an Intel product but so far has really only shown up in Mac computers. It is the fastest consumer external connection, but it is also very expensive. Often drives are sold without the cords, which themselves cost an extra $50. USB 3.0 is very fast compared to the previous generation USB 3.0 and is much cheaper. This is pretty ubiquitous now on new computers from Apple and Windows.</p>

<h4 id="ssd-fast-and-furious-with-a-price-to-match">SSD: fast and furious with a price to match</h4>

<p>If money is no object, I recommend an SSD with either Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 connection, depending on the fastest connection your computer has. The one caveat is that SSDs are typical smaller than HDD and are very expensive a larger sizes. If you have an 500GB+ HDD, then you’ll need to stick with an HDD. However, if like me, you have something like a Macbook Air with a 128 or 256 GB SSD, then this is a great option. For a top-of-the-line, blazingly fast, SSD/Thunderbolt drive, you can get the Elgato 240GB for $480. A really beautiful option, and only a bit slower but much cheaper, is the 240 GB OWC SSD/USB 3.0 <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/ENVPROU3S240/">Envoy Pro EX</a> for $320. (This is probably what I would get if I had the money. It’s not as fast, but way better looking.)</p>

<p>A few cheaper options include the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shadow-trade-240GB-External-Portable/dp/B004G7KK30/?tag=soitscometothis-20">U32 Shadow 240GB USB 2.0 SSD</a> for $250 and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Verbatim-Store-External-Solid-47622/dp/B008OE0S56/?tag=soitscometothis-20">Verbatim Store ‘n’ Go 128 GB USB 3.0 SSD</a> for $150.</p>

<h4 id="hdd-steady-and-solid">HDD: steady and solid</h4>

<p>A mid-range choice, and what I use, is a HDD with Thunderbolt connection. HDDs are significantly slower than SSDs but without the prohibitively high price. I can make two clone back ups on separate devices (one for home and one for work, i.e. off site back up) for the price of an SSD and the drives are still large enough for lots of extra storage space in addition. I have/use two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Thunderbolt-Portable-Drive/dp/B008D4X9UI/?tag=soitscometothis-20">Buffalo MiniStation 1 TB Thunderbolt / USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive with Thunderbolt Cable</a>. This has both the USB 3.0 and the Thunderbolt connections and comes with both cables. The 1TB model is only $208 on Amazon right now and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Thunderbolt-Portable-Drive/dp/B008D4X9UI/?tag=soitscometothis-20">500GB is $143</a>.</p>

<p>If you drop the Thunderbolt connection for USB 3.0 you can significantly cut the price. A Buffalo drive with only USB 3.0 runs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Plus-Portable-Drive/dp/B005EJLFVK/?tag=soitscometothis-20">$70 for 500GB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Plus-Portable-Drive/dp/B005EJLFVK/?tag=soitscometothis-20">$84 for 1TB</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Plus-Portable-Drive/dp/B005EJLFVK/?tag=soitscometothis-20">$200 for 2 TB</a>.</p>

<p>If you are on a shoe-string budget or only have a USB 2.0 connection then the specific model doesn’t matter as much. You can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Hard-Drive-WDBL1D5000ABK-NESN/dp/B005DKZW5A/?tag=soitscometothis-20">WD My Passport 500GB USB 2.0</a> but considering you can get a much better drive for $20 more and the speed will be agonizingly slow, I really don’t recommend going this route. The only way I’d do this is if you have hardly any money at all and already own an old USB 2.0 drive.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The first time you run the cloning software, it will take awhile. Depending on your connection it could be an hour to all night. After that it will much faster as it will only incrementally update changes. My updates typically take around 6 minutes.</p>

<p>Enjoy your new power and piece of mind. You just earned +10 nerd CME.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/a-public-occurrence/">A Public Occurrence</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I was sitting in a public place, minding my own business. An elderly gentleman sat down next to me and started to have a very loud phone conversation with what apparently was an insurance company. The salient points are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>His fiancé was in a car accident last week.</li>
  <li>She was hit from behind.</li>
  <li>She reportedly broke her sternum.</li>
  <li>She “is quite messed up.”</li>
</ol>

<p>He proceeded to slowly spell the name of his fiancé, the name of driver of the other car, and a bunch of personal details such as birth date, phone number, addresses, insurance numbers, etc.. The fiancé walked around, moved both arms with as normal of a range of motion as can be tested by observation alone, and carried a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Association-Family-Legal-Guide/dp/0812923618?tag=soitscometothis-20">book that weighs 4 lbs</a>.</p>

<p>After he got off the phone, she sat down and started going through the book, occasionally reading out a passage and the saying that they should get the lawyer to “add that charge.”</p>

<p>Then they thumbed through the yellow pages writing down numbers for attorneys.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Mute-commercials-on-CBS-or-Hulu-with-Keyboard-Maestro/">Mute commercials on CBS or Hulu with Keyboard Maestro</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>In a game of one-upmanship, I’ve improved on my prior macros for muting commercials on CBS and Hulu. What used to be 1-3 non-annoying commercials<sup id="fnref:1363103721-fn1"><a href="#fn:1363103721-fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> has turned into five, highly-annoying, commercials in a row. The volume is often much louder than the volume of the show and not infrequently, the same commercial is played all 5 times.</p>

<p>To combat this I made two small changes. First, I combined the two macros into one so I don’t have to remember two hot keys or which site I’m watching. A simple Applescript snippet captures the URL from Chrome and an if/then statement looks for the network name in the url. The second change involves turning the screen off and on in addition to toggling the mute key.</p>

<p>The macro flows thus:</p>

<pre>
- Execute Applescript `tell application "Google Chrome" to get the URL of active tab of first window` and save results to variable `currentURL`
- If `currentURL` contains CBS then
    - Toggle system sound mute
    - Repeat action 16 times: decrease screen brightness
    - Execute following action until none of the conditions are met
        - none (this is basically just a pause until)
        - Conditions: screen contains image (the image is the "advertisement" graphic that is displayed during a commercial)
    - Toggle system sound mute
    - Repeat action 16 times: increase screen brightness
- otherwise execute the following
    - If `currentURL` contains hulu then
        - Toggle system sound mute
        - Repeat action 16 times: decrease screen brightness
        - Execute following action until none of the conditions are met
            - none (this is basically just a pause until)
            - Conditions: screen contains image (the image is the "advertisement" graphic that is displayed during a commercial)
        - Toggle system sound mute
        - Repeat action 16 times: increase screen brightness
    - otherwise do nothing
</pre>

<p>I haven’t figured out a way to automatically call this macro when the commercials start. I could watch for the “advertisement” graphic but I think that would be way too CPU intensive. I’ll keep thinking about it.</p>

<p>I encourage you to make your own macro to learn the system, and you might have to in order to get the correct “advertisement” graphic, but you can get mine <a href="/images/mute_Commercials.kmmacros">here</a>. (right click to download)</p>

      <div class="content"><p>I repeatedly see articles blaming physicians for the poor adoption of technology in medicine. As a tech nerd and a physician who is frustrated with the lack of good medical software (mostly EMRs), it was nice to see an article putting the blame where it mostly belongs: regulation and hospitals.<sup id="fnref:1363099346-fn1"><a href="#fn:1363099346-fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/NSHBIZboyer">E.J. Boyer</a> for the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/print-edition/2013/03/08/app-craze-hits-hospitals-as-doctors-go.html">Nashville Business Journal</a> (subscription only):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A] growing number of physicians are taking a cue from their personal lives and using mobile devices to make their jobs more efficient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just like “normal people”, physicians want their life to be easier and when they see how technology improves one aspect of their life, they want to see similar improvements in other aspects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But industry experts predict the road to adoption won’t be easy, as data security, IT integration and looming federal regulations come into play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A constant problem in all areas of medicine, regulations continue to choke the life out of medical practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But even as physicians continue to see the benefits of mobile apps in practicing medicine, experts warn the road to full adoption will be long. For starters, health apps and mobile devices present a new privacy and security challenge for hospitals, which operate under tight regulations and strict federal patient privacy laws.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Physicians are driving the need for it. They want to be able to see the data on the phones and iPads, but the hospitals are not jumping on it as quickly.</p>

<p>When I got the first iPad, I was told by hospital IT that it “couldn’t connect” to the system. When I figured out how to get it connected, I was told it was “not allowed”. They refused to explain how accessing the system from my laptop at home (fully supported) was different than accessing the system from my iPad as we rounded on patients. Eventually, as more higher level attendings bought the devices for themselves, seeing how useful they were to the residents, the policy changed to “not supported”. I wonder if that’s changed any since I left?<sup id="fnref:1363099346-fn2"><a href="#fn:1363099346-fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

  <p>Another road block to mobile adoption is integration of apps into a hospitals IT system.</p>

<p>This is because the EMRs that hospitals use are closed, proprietary systems. They are built on old architectural standards. The database systems are closed and or proprietary. There are no APIs. The EMR companies want to keep the system closed to stifle competition. They want to be the only one that can make an app for their system and they charge astronomical prices for mobile apps for their EMRs, often a large percentage of the original cost all over again.</p>

<p>I still remain optimistic that one day cooperate medicine will have and use decent technology, although I’m realistic enough to know this may never happen in my lifetime. Until then, I will continue to develop my own private systems for my every day practice.</p>

<p>As for the truly luddite physicians out there: eventually they’ll die<sup id="fnref:1363099346-fn3"><a href="#fn:1363099346-fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, and if the technology is good enough to provide substantial benefits to those physicians using it, the luddites won’t be able to compete.</p>

      <p>I was also told that Macs were not able to be used as the technology wouldn’t work. Within 2 months my fellowship program had switched to Macs, but I had had to do most of the work. At one point I tried to talk to the Mac guy in IT had was repeatedly told “There isn’t one.” It ended up that he was on vacation, and when he got back he responded to the long email chain saying “Hey, I do exist. I’m right here!”</p>

      <p>I think a lot of the resistance is aversion to more work, interestingly, coming from the technology people, not the physicians/users. <a href="#fnref:1363099346-fn2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
