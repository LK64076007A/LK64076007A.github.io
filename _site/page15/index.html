      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Create-side-by-side-screen-shots-on-iOS-with-Pythonista/">Create side-by-side screen shots on iOS with Pythonista</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>First, I have to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a>, whose <a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/chaining-tweetbot-pythonista-drafts-and-imessage-for-urls/">detailed</a> <a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/from-instapaper-and-pythonista-to-dropbox-and-evernote-as-pdf/">blog</a> <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/automating-ios-how-pythonista-changed-my-workflow/">posts</a> on his use of Pythonista inspired me to use it and learn Python as well.</p>

<p>I don’t use iOS devices as exclusively as he does, but when I am using them I want them to be as powerful and automated as my Mac is. One use case that Federico demonstrated was using Pythonista to take two screen shots (such as of an app before and after an update) and create a new image of both screen shots side by side, such as he might need for an app review blog post. His old script was a bit hacky due to the situation at the time.</p>

<p>Pythonista was <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/pythonista-1-3-brings-camera-roll-and-notification-center-support-new-library-view-and-more/">recently updated</a> to include the ability to pick images from the camera roll from inside Pythonista as well as the ability to save generated images to the camera roll.</p>

<p>I decided to fork his original code to include these features and to remove some options that I don’t need.</p>

<p>When you run this script you will be prompted to choose an image from the camera roll. This will be the image on the left of the combined final image. Then you will be prompted to choose a second image. Naturally, this image will be on the right. The image will be generated and saved to the camera roll.</p>

<p>You can get the script from Gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/LK64076007A/5090763">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>"""
This code takes two screenshots from the camera roll combines them into one image and saves the new image to the camera roll.

This is adapted from Federico Viticci's blog post at:
http://www.macstories.net/stories/automating-ios-how-pythonista-changed-my-workflow/
It removes the option to change which picture is where, automatically assigning the first one chosen as the leftmost image.
It also removes the necessity to copy the images to the clipboard outside of Pythonista using the new photos library in version 1.3. Finally, it removes the clipboard output.
"""

import photos
import Image
import console

im1 = photos.pick_image(show_albums=False)
im2 = photos.pick_image(show_albums=False)

background = Image.new('RGBA', (746,650), (255, 255, 255, 255))

console.clear()
print "Generating image..."
console.show_activity()

_1 = im1.resize((366,650),Image.ANTIALIAS)
_2 = im2.resize((366,650),Image.ANTIALIAS)
background.paste(_1,(0,0))
background.paste(_2,(380,0))
photos.save_image(background)
console.hide_activity()
print "Image saved to camera roll."
</code></pre>

<p>Here’s an image I created with it for an upcoming comparison of the text-parsing of Pocket vs. Instapaper:</p>

<p><a href="/images/sidebyside.jpg"><img src="/images/sidebyside.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Next, I need to make a way for this image to be uploaded to my public Dropbox folder and the public link to be placed in the clipboard.</p>

<p>I can’t wait for more posts by Frederico so I can keep learning.</p>

      <div class="content"><p><strong>Update:</strong> This macro was made for Keyboard Maestro 5. Although it will work with KM 6, a newer version of the macro is available as is much simpler and faster with less risk of bugs.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>Safari is my typical browser of choice, but sometimes I want to open a webpage I’m already looking at in Safari in Chrome instead<sup id="fnref:20130228142554"><a href="#fn:20130228142554" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Sometimes I’m looking at a webpage in Chrome and want to open it in Safari.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>It’s not super elegant, but I made a Keyboard Maestro macro to switch back and forth.</p>

<p>It consists of two nested if/then statements that check for which browser I’m using, grabs the URL of the front window, opens the other browser, pauses until the browser is running and the front window is open, pastes the URL into the navigation bar, and finally hits enter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If Safari is at the front
    <ul>
      <li>Execute the Applescript <code>tell application "Safari" to get the URL of the front document</code> and save results to variable <code>currentURL</code></li>
      <li>Activate Google Chrome</li>
      <li>Pause until Google Chrome is at the front and the front window exists</li>
      <li>Type the keystroke ⌘T</li>
      <li>Type the keystroke ⌘L</li>
      <li>Insert the text by pasting: <code>current URL</code></li>
      <li>Type the keystroke <code>return</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>otherwise execute the following
    <ul>
      <li>If Google Chrome is at the front
        <ul>
          <li>Execute Applescript <code>tell application "Google Chrome" to get the URL of active tab of first window</code> and save results to variable <code>currentURL</code></li>
          <li>Activate Safari</li>
          <li>Pause until Safari is at the front and the front window exists</li>
          <li>Type the keystroke ⌘T</li>
          <li>Type the keystroke ⌘L</li>
          <li>Insert the text by pasting: <code>current URL</code></li>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Text-to-speech-for-OS-X-and-iOS/">Text-to-speech for OS X and iOS</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I love to read and have to read a lot for my work and hobbies, but sometimes, for various reasons, reading is not ideal. Maybe my eyes are tired. Maybe I need to do something physical that precludes the physical act of reading but not the mental aspect.<sup id="fnref:201302261054"><a href="#fn:201302261054" class="footnote">1</a></sup> In those situations, I let my software read to me with text-to-speech.</p>

<h2 id="text-to-speech-on-ios">Text-to-speech on iOS</h2>

<p>Text-to-speech on iOS is already built into the OS. To turn it on go to <code>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Speak Selection</code> and turn it on. You can also switch the dialect if you want.<sup id="fnref:1302260948"><a href="#fn:1302260948" class="footnote">2</a></sup> From now on, when you highlight any text, one of the options on the pop up menu will be “speak”. Hit this and the text will be read to you. There is a major limitation with this: <strong>if you lock the device or switch to a different application, the reading stops.</strong></p>

<p>Another option is a dedicated app. <a href="https://twitter.com/SiMBa37">A colleague</a> recommends <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voice-dream-reader-text-to/id496177674?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">Voice Dream Reader</a> for 10 USD in the App Store. I have not used it so I can’t comment on it.</p>

<h2 id="text-to-speech-on-os-x">Text-to-speech on OS X</h2>

<p>OS X also has built-in text-to-speech software. As far as I can tell, it is always on, but that may be a left over preference on my machine from years back so to check, go to  <code>System Preferences &gt; Dictation &amp; Speech</code>. I also turn on the keyboard shortcut for this. Otherwise, all you need to do is highlight some text, right click, and select <code>Speech &gt; Start Speaking</code>.</p>

<p>I use this frequently when reading an article and I get tired, or I need to be doing something else like cooking at the same time. I’ve also found that just turning this on when reading something important like a medical journal article lets others know I’m doing something work related rather than just surfing the internet for memes, i.e. don’t interrupt. It is also a great way to proof read your writing. What your eyes often miss, your ears will clearly hear.</p>

<h2 id="text-to-speech-os-x-to-ios">Text-to-speech OS X to iOS</h2>

<p>Sometimes there is a very large article I want to read but don’t want to sit at my machine for an extended period to time. Thankfully, OS X has some built in functions that allow you to turn the text into an audio file using the text-to-speech functions. OS X comes with this ability pre-programmed in the services section. To turn it on, go to <code>System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts &gt; Services &gt; Text</code> and make sure <code>Add to iTunes as a Spoken…</code> is checked. From then on, when you have text highlighted, you can right click, go to Services, and click on <code>Add to iTunes as a Spoken…</code>. This will convert the text-to-speech, first as a lossless AIFF (a very large file). It will then re-encode using AAC (to make it a smaller file) and then import into iTunes under a special playlist.</p>

<p>This works fine in general, but I don’t usually sync my iPhone with iTunes as I keep most things in the cloud. Thankfully, Automator<sup id="fnref:1302261013"><a href="#fn:1302261013" class="footnote">3</a></sup> makes it very easy to create your own.<sup id="fnref:201302261023"><a href="#fn:201302261023" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/images/AutomatorTTS.png"><img src="/images/AutomatorTTS.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This creates a service for when text is selected. You run it the same as the prior service: right click, go to Services, and click on <code>The Name of the Service</code>. It changes the text to audio format, saving to the location of your choice, and using the voice of your choice. It then re-encodes the file to a format most compatible with spoken word, thus greatly decreasing the file size, and deletes the original file. I have it save to a folder inside Dropbox so that I can play it later (or sooner) on any device I have.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Batch-converting-Pages-documents-to-PDF/">Batch converting Pages documents to PDF with Keyboard Maestro</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I had 3000 Pages documents that I wanted to convert PDF. I had previously searched the internet for a way to do this easily but was unsuccessful. I suppose I should have tried searching again, because I would have found <a href="http://www.yourmacteacher.com/batch-convert-pages-documents-to-pdf/">Pages2PDF</a>, which works much better than what I did.</p>

<p>Still, relying on someone to create the exact program you need is not as fun or as useful as being able to fix the problem yourself. So I created a Keyboard Maestro macro.</p>

<p>Basically, this automates the steps I would have had to do manually:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the file in Pages.</li>
  <li>Select Export to PDF from the menu.</li>
  <li>Fix the file name.<sup id="fnref:130218165655"><a href="#fn:130218165655" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Move the original file to a new location.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Keyboard Maestro parlance the steps were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For Each Item in a the Finder’s selection
    <ol>
      <li>Set the file name to a variable fileName</li>
      <li>Set the file path to a variable filePath</li>
      <li>Open the file at filePath/fileName<sup id="fnref:130218170000"><a href="#fn:130218170000" class="footnote">2</a></sup> in Pages.</li>
      <li>Pause for 1.5 seconds.<sup id="fnref:130218170107"><a href="#fn:130218170107" class="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
      <li>Select the menu item PDF… in the submenu Export in the Menu Title File.</li>
      <li>Press the Button labeled “Next…”</li>
      <li>Insert the text from variable %WindowName%1% by pasting. (Basically, this names the file being exported the same as the original file name, except for the extension.)</li>
      <li>Press the button labeled “Export”.</li>
      <li>Type the keystroke ?-W (to close the open file)</li>
      <li>Move the file %Variable%filePath%/%Variable%fileName% to whateverLocationYouWant/%Variable%fileName%</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It worked perfectly if somewhat slow. It took several hours to process all the files.</p>
