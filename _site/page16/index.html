      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Batch-converting-Pages-documents-to-PDF/">Batch converting Pages documents to PDF with Keyboard Maestro</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I had 3000 Pages documents that I wanted to convert PDF. I had previously searched the internet for a way to do this easily but was unsuccessful. I suppose I should have tried searching again, because I would have found <a href="http://www.yourmacteacher.com/batch-convert-pages-documents-to-pdf/">Pages2PDF</a>, which works much better than what I did.</p>

<p>Still, relying on someone to create the exact program you need is not as fun or as useful as being able to fix the problem yourself. So I created a Keyboard Maestro macro.</p>

<p>Basically, this automates the steps I would have had to do manually:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the file in Pages.</li>
  <li>Select Export to PDF from the menu.</li>
  <li>Fix the file name.<sup id="fnref:130218165655"><a href="#fn:130218165655" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Move the original file to a new location.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Keyboard Maestro parlance the steps were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For Each Item in a the Finder’s selection
    <ol>
      <li>Set the file name to a variable fileName</li>
      <li>Set the file path to a variable filePath</li>
      <li>Open the file at filePath/fileName<sup id="fnref:130218170000"><a href="#fn:130218170000" class="footnote">2</a></sup> in Pages.</li>
      <li>Pause for 1.5 seconds.<sup id="fnref:130218170107"><a href="#fn:130218170107" class="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
      <li>Select the menu item PDF… in the submenu Export in the Menu Title File.</li>
      <li>Press the Button labeled “Next…”</li>
      <li>Insert the text from variable %WindowName%1% by pasting. (Basically, this names the file being exported the same as the original file name, except for the extension.)</li>
      <li>Press the button labeled “Export”.</li>
      <li>Type the keystroke ?-W (to close the open file)</li>
      <li>Move the file %Variable%filePath%/%Variable%fileName% to whateverLocationYouWant/%Variable%fileName%</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It worked perfectly if somewhat slow. It took several hours to process all the files.</p>

    <li id="fn:130218170000">
      <p>I don’t know why I had to specifically use the path and name. Sometimes KM works fine without that and sometimes it doesn’t. I haven’t figured out why and when. <a href="#fnref:130218170000" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The proposals are a result of numerous factors, including a sharp drop in law school applications, the outsourcing of research over the Internet, a glut of underemployed and indebted law school graduates and a high percentage of the legal needs of Americans going unmet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is almost universal agreement that the current system is broken,” said Thomas W. Lyons III, a Rhode Island lawyer and a member of the American Bar Association’s Task Force on the Future of Legal Education, which gathered here over the weekend for a public hearing at the association’s midyear meeting.</p>

<p>This sounds eerily similar to the situation in the medical world (minus the part about underemployment).</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/NIH-Stroke-Scale/">NIH Stroke Scale with Keyboard Maestro and TextExpander</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>A colleague of mine wanted a way to easily document the NIH stroke scale score with the added benefits of not having to type the whole thing each time, prompts to remember what to evaluate and what the scores mean, and also have the final score calculated for him. Requirements included that the input had to be in TextExpander due to a preference for that applications input style, and the output would have to be in the middle of a Pages document that was using a single font and no bold or italics.</p>

<p>He had already created the TextExpander snippet and basically needed me to figure out a way to use KM to calculate the score and put it into the note. Oh, one more thing: He wanted to do this with only one command.</p>

<h2 id="challenge-accepted">Challenge accepted!</h2>

<p>The KM macro first types out the shortcut for the TE macro, which calls the TE snippet pop up window, and then pauses until the TE snippet window disappears.</p>

<p>The TE window has all the steps of the NIH Stroke Scale including prompts to remind the user how to do it correctly.</p>

<p><a href="/images/NIH_stroke_TE_menu.png"><img src="/images/NIH_stroke_TE_menu.png" alt="NIH Stroke Scale TE Menu" /></a></p>

<p>Once the TE part is complete, the KM macro continues. All it really does it use regular expressions to find the individual numbers in the scale and add them together for the final score. Since the final score is really just simple addition of 15 single digit numbers, the whole exercise is a bit of a Rube Goldberg, but it was fun anyway and any less brain power and time needed at 2 in the morning during a stroke is probably a good thing.</p>

<p>And the final result:</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Stupid-EMR-UI-Example-2/">Stupid EMR UI Example 2</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I love tech and I especially love software, but like most things that we deeply love, when they fall short, it’s very hard to not get angry.</p>

<p>This is one reason I have such a hatred for the current state of Electronic Medical Records. They’re abysmal. <a href="http://vimeo.com/31926572">John Gruber even makes fun of them</a>. (Minute 24:28, but the whole talk is worth listening too.)</p>

<p>Today I share <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/stupid-emr-ui">another example</a> of poor design.</p>

<p>In the EMR I use now, NextGen, I’ve been complaining about the joint injection procedure template for 1.5 years. They still haven’t fixed it.</p>

<p>I use a standard medication called Synvisc One. Synvisc regular is a 2ml (16mg) injection you give once a week for 3 weeks. Synvisc One is all 6ml (48mg) given at once.</p>

<p>Just to lay out all the numbers for you. This medication is available as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2ml</li>
  <li>6ml</li>
  <li>16mg</li>
  <li>48mg</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Two strengths. Expressed either in a volume or a mass.</p>

<p>You can document this in two places in the procedure template. I want to point out, that this is the first mistake, having two places to document one thing.</p>

<p>And here’s how they look:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Synvisc_Nextgen_order_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>First, there’s no units. Specifically it just says “units”. Is that milliliters? Liters? Milligrams? Grams? Number of injections? Is this for Synvisc or Synvisc One? If I pick one of these, what am I actually documenting or ordering? The closest guess is that this is in milliliters, but then you can’t pick “6”, the size of Synvisc One. There is a “2”, so you could document Synvisc regular. Even then, <strong>1 in 5 available choices will always be wrong</strong>. Why even offer a possible wrong choice?!?! I also point out that this is a pop up menu, so you’ve already been removed from the screen you’re working on.</p>

<p>And here is how the second place to document it looks:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Synvisc_Nextgen_order_2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This one at least has units, but still has all the other problems.</p>

<p>I would offer the following fixes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have only one place to order the drug.</li>
  <li>Instead of a pop up window, make it a radial button choice.</li>
  <li>Have two options: Synvisc and Synvisc One</li>
</ol>

<p>This improve things as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Only one place to document.</li>
  <li>No choices that are wrong.</li>
  <li>No extra pop up menu.</li>
  <li>No need for the user to know the milligrams, milliliters, or any other unit. They just need to be able to read what is on the box.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope that before I die<sup id="fnref:1301182110"><a href="#fn:1301182110" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, a decent EMR exists.</p>

<p>We have a long way to go.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Inline-Markdown-links-from-Safari-tabs/">Inline Markdown links from Safari tabs</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>This post is mostly for me, so I can remember how I did this in the future.</p>

<p>I was creating show notes for a podcast I do. I needed to make a list of links to scientific papers. Even using Markdown rather than HTML it took me an insanely long amount of time to manually copy over the titles and links. So I decided I’d spend the next hour never doing that again.</p>

<p>First, I figured out a way to get the links easily. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> does not have a way to easily copy out the information directly, but it does have a way to highlight all the papers you want to link and open them all in tabs in your browser.</p>

<p>Now that I had all the papers open in their own tab, I needed a way to make Markdown links from them. I thought I had read something about doing this before, but I couldn’t find it again<sup id="fnref:1301132310"><a href="#fn:1301132310" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I did find <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/07/markdown-reference-links-from-safari-tabs/">a post by Dr. Drang</a> that got me halfway there. The only problem was that his method only gave me the second half of a list of reference links when what I wanted was inline links with the title of the webpage as the text.</p>

<p>His technique gave me this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[1]: website url
[2]: website url
[3]: website url
[4]: website url
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When what I wanted was this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>[Website Title](website url)
[Website Title](website url)
[Website Title](website url)
[Website Title](website url)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I like reference links too, but I needed the title of the paper for my purposes and I already have another macro that I use to turn inline links into reference links later.</p>

<p>My Applescript knowledge is weak, but I quickly found <a href="http://lucifr.com/2012/09/01/selected-safari-tabs-to-markdown-reference-links/">this page</a>, which I can’t read because it’s in Chinese, and by looking at the code, figured out how to get what I needed.</p>

<p>I changed Dr. Drang’s original code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>tell application "Safari"
  set i to 1
  set links to ""
  repeat with t in every tab in front window
    set links to links &amp; "[" &amp; i &amp; "]: " &amp; the URL of t &amp; linefeed
    set i to i + 1
  end repeat
  return links
end tell
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>to this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>tell application "Safari"
  set i to 1
  set links to ""
  repeat with t in every tab in front window
    set links to links &amp; "[" &amp;the name of t&amp; "](" &amp; the URL of t &amp;")"&amp; linefeed
    set i to i + 1
  end repeat
  return links
end tell
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can then throw that into a TextExpander snippet or a Keyboard Maestro Macro and you’re prestige.</p>

<p>Frankly, Papers needs a way to do this in the app itself.</p>
