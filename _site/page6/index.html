<blockquote>
  <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of the United States today filed a federal court complaint against AT&amp;T, accusing the carrier of misleading its smartphone customers by charging them for unlimited data while reducing their data speeds by up to 90 percent. - <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/28/ftc-sues-att-unlimited-data-throttling/">MacRumors</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had one of those “unlimited” plans and AT&amp;T sent rude text messages threatening to throttle me and then eventually did. I was using just over 2 gigabytes a month. I switched to Sprint.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The FTC alleges that AT&amp;T throttled customers who had used as little as 2GB of data beginning in 2011, and that the throttling is severe, “resulting in speed reductions of 80 to 90 percent for affected users.” AT&amp;T is said to have throttled 3.5 million customers more than 25 million times, violating the FTC Act in the process.  - <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/28/ftc-sues-att-unlimited-data-throttling/">MacRumors</a></p>

      <div class="content"><p>I like using static text documents to generate my blog. As many others have already said, it gives me control over my product and is easy to maintain and change. For the last several years, I’ve enjoyed using <a href="http://scriptogr.am">Scriptogram</a>, which both generated the HTML files from the text files stored in Dropbox, and also hosted the generated files. It was even free.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it does not seem to be in active development anymore. I probably could have left it alone and waited until the service died, but I got an itching in my brain after listening to the <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2014/10/episode-160-the-guarantee-of-free-speech/">last episode of Core Intuition</a> and decide to take a second crack<sup id="fnref:141028124001"><a href="#fn:141028124001" class="footnote">1</a></sup> at doing my own file generation and hosting<sup id="fnref:141028124050"><a href="#fn:141028124050" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I’m currently getting my blog ported over to a Github hosted Jekyll site. Of course, I didn’t do the smart thing and wait until everything was finished before switching over the DNS, because <em>stupid</em> and I didn’t actually think anyone read this site<sup id="fnref:141028124228"><a href="#fn:141028124228" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Unfortunately, at least one person does and I wasted their time today when they tried to report a broken link in their feed reader.</p>

<p>My apologies. Hopefully the DNS and RSS is finished. No I just need to import my old articles and futz with the CSS. The latter shouldn’t cause any problems, and I hope the former doesn’t flood anyone’s RSS reader with old posts.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Create-a-Markdown-link-with-automatic-affiliate-codes/">Create a Markdown link with automatic affiliate codes</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I do a podcast with a couple other guys. As we’re recording the show, I like to create the show notes live so that they’re most accurate and save myself time later. We frequently mention products on Amazon, apps on iTunes, and regular old-fashioned links. I created the following macro for myself so that after I’ve navigated to the webpage of the link in Safari, I can automatically create a Markdown-style link in my text editor, including optional Amazon and iTunes affiliate links if appropriate. The affiliate links are added using python scrips from <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/08/new-apple-affiliate-link-scripts/">Dr. Drang</a> and <a href="http://nerdgap.com/amazon-affiliate-links-with-textexpander/">Brett Kelly</a>.</p>

<p>The macro can be triggered by the string <code class="highlighter-rouge">mdlink</code> of the hotkey ⇧⌃⌥⌘p.</p>

<p>Since I write all my show notes in nvALT and my workflow is to find the webpage in Safari, the first part of the macro activates nvALT. The topmost Safari URL is then saved to the clipboard. The clipboard is then parsed by two If statements looking to see if it is an Amazon or iTunes link, and if it is add the affiliate code. Finally, the text for the Markdown link in inserted using the Safari title as the text for the link.</p>
