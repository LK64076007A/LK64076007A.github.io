  <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of the United States today filed a federal court complaint against AT&amp;T, accusing the carrier of misleading its smartphone customers by charging them for unlimited data while reducing their data speeds by up to 90 percent. - <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/28/ftc-sues-att-unlimited-data-throttling/">MacRumors</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had one of those “unlimited” plans and AT&amp;T sent rude text messages threatening to throttle me and then eventually did. I was using just over 2 gigabytes a month. I switched to Sprint. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The FTC alleges that AT&amp;T throttled customers who had used as little as 2GB of data beginning in 2011, and that the throttling is severe, “resulting in speed reductions of 80 to 90 percent for affected users.” AT&amp;T is said to have throttled 3.5 million customers more than 25 million times, violating the FTC Act in the process.  - <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/28/ftc-sues-att-unlimited-data-throttling/">MacRumors</a></p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2014/10/28/Changing-blog-platform-and-host.html">Changing blog platform and host</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I like using static text documents to generate my blog. As many others have already said, it gives me control over my product and is easy to maintain and change. For the last several years, I’ve enjoyed using <a href="http://scriptogr.am">Scriptogram</a>, which both generated the HTML files from the text files stored in Dropbox, and also hosted the generated files. It was even free. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it does not seem to be in active development anymore. I probably could have left it alone and waited until the service died, but I got an itching in my brain after listening to the <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2014/10/episode-160-the-guarantee-of-free-speech/">last episode of Core Intuition</a> and decide to take a second crack<sup id="fnref:141028124001"><a href="#fn:141028124001" class="footnote">1</a></sup> at doing my own file generation and hosting<sup id="fnref:141028124050"><a href="#fn:141028124050" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>

<p>I’m currently getting my blog ported over to a Github hosted Jekyll site. Of course, I didn’t do the smart thing and wait until everything was finished before switching over the DNS, because <em>stupid</em> and I didn’t actually think anyone read this site<sup id="fnref:141028124228"><a href="#fn:141028124228" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Unfortunately, at least one person does and I wasted their time today when they tried to report a broken link in their feed reader. </p>

<p>My apologies. Hopefully the DNS and RSS is finished. No I just need to import my old articles and futz with the CSS. The latter shouldn’t cause any problems, and I hope the former doesn’t flood anyone’s RSS reader with old posts. </p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2014/08/01/Create-a-Markdown-link-with-automatic-affiliate-codes.html">Create a Markdown link with automatic affiliate codes</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I do a podcast with a couple other guys. As we’re recording the show, I like to create the show notes live so that they’re most accurate and save myself time later. We frequently mention products on Amazon, apps on iTunes, and regular old-fashioned links. I created the following macro for myself so that after I’ve navigated to the webpage of the link in Safari, I can automatically create a Markdown-style link in my text editor, including optional Amazon and iTunes affiliate links if appropriate. The affiliate links are added using python scrips from <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/08/new-apple-affiliate-link-scripts/">Dr. Drang</a> and <a href="http://nerdgap.com/amazon-affiliate-links-with-textexpander/">Brett Kelly</a>.</p>

<p>The macro can be triggered by the string <code>mdlink</code> of the hotkey ⇧⌃⌥⌘p.</p>

<p>Since I write all my show notes in nvALT and my workflow is to find the webpage in Safari, the first part of the macro activates nvALT. The topmost Safari URL is then saved to the clipboard. The clipboard is then parsed by two If statements looking to see if it is an Amazon or iTunes link, and if it is add the affiliate code. Finally, the text for the Markdown link in inserted using the Safari title as the text for the link.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2014/07/29/Keyboard-Maestro-macro-screenshots.html">Keyboard Maestro macro screenshots</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I create a lot of macros with KM and I like to share them both on this blog as well as in the KM forums<sup id="fnref:140729172855"><a href="#fn:140729172855" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Taking screenshots of the macro is an important part of this sharing and has been very useful to me as I have learned to use KM from my betters in the community. Previously, I would use the standard screen shot functions of OS X, but with very long macros that did not all fit on one screen there was no elegant solution.</p>

<p>I believe it was in <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/documentation/6/keyboardmaestro.html">6.0</a> that Peter added the ability to copy a macro as an image. I failed to pay much attention to this at the time in light of all the other great functionality, but recently put it to use.</p>

<p>The copy as an image puts the highlighted portion of your macro into the clipboard. By itself, this isn’t very useful because I need an actual image to upload to the blog, and as far as I can tell that functionality is not built in<sup id="fnref:140729173600"><a href="#fn:140729173600" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>

<p>So I created a macro.</p>

<h2 id="macro-description">Macro description</h2>

<p>You can either select individual parts of the macro you want to share, or select nothing and the whole macro will be used.</p>

<p>Using a hotkey, trigger the <em>Create Screenshot Macro</em>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <code>copy as image</code> from the menu</li>
  <li>Prompt the user for the file name</li>
  <li>Save the file to the desktop</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s also a <code>copy as text</code> if you want to just share the text of the macro. I prefer to write my own descriptions because I think it’s more useful, but including the text is nice too. See below.</p>

<h2 id="macro-text">Macro text</h2>

<p>Create screenshot of KM macro<br />

The Hot Key ⌃⌥⇧⌘M is pressed<br />

  <p>While drug reps are certainly in sales, I have only personally seen a drug rep step over the line on one occasion. A new rep, who was clearly green, actually said to me and my colleague, “what would it take to get you to prescribe more of this drug?” I don’t think he was suggesting anything like bribery, but the statement was clearly inappropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been asked that question before. Based on context, I didn’t assume I was being bribed. I took it as “what medical and financial factors are keeping you from using my medication over another?”</p>

<p>My answers have been along the lines of “make it cheaper and/or show evidence of superiority in head-to-head trials”.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the £100 that was offered to the physicians in the referenced article is a lot less than the financial incentive when a patient demands oxycodone while holding a patient satisfaction survey. </p>

      <div class="content"><p>I happened to learn that Dragon Dictate is being upgraded. I own MacSpeech Dictate Medical, which was bought out by Nuance, so I decide to check it out and possibly upgrade.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Dragon-01.png"><img src="/images/Dragon-01.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>Wow. $1000. That’s a lot for something I don’t use that much.</p>

<p>But look, I can upgrade for only $500. I’ll check that out.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Dragon-02.png"><img src="/images/Dragon-02.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>Just need to log into my account.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Dragon-03.png"><img src="/images/Dragon-03.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>Look, it’s only $300. I’ll totally buy that.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Dragon-04.png"><img src="/images/Dragon-04.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>WTF? That says $600, and it’s for MacSpeech Medical not Dragon Dictate Medical.</p>

<p>To be perfectly clear. Each screen shot was take in a single series of links, one to the other. The price kept changing. The product kept changing. What is going on here?</p>

<p>I have no idea what the problem is, but I’m not comfortable with moving forward with this purchase. </p>
