      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/TextExpander-for-physicians-part-1">TextExpander for physicians, Part 1</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>As a physician I write a lot.<sup id="fnref:1201301814"><a href="#fn:1201301814" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Most of my writing is the same or similar to things I’ve written before and will write again. Repeatedly typing the same things character by character is a waste of time, energy and cartilage. In order to turn my 70 word per minute<sup id="fnref:1201302145"><a href="#fn:1201302145" class="footnote">2</a></sup> into hundreds of words per minute without ended up as a patient myself, I engage a force multiplier, TextExpander.</p>

<p>TextExpander is a text macro program. Simply put, you type a few characters and the program outputs quite a bit more characters. In the last 6 months of use, it’s saved me from typing over 1/2 a million characters, saving an estimated 24 hours of time based on 70 words per minute or at a more typical physician rate of 40 words per minutes, it’s saved me almost 2 solid days of typing.</p>

<p>But like all beautiful things there’s so much more than that.</p>

<h3 id="personal-history">Personal history</h3>

<p>I’ve been using text macros since junior high school. When writing a history day paper, instead of typing “Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry”, I typed CMCP and the whole name would spring forth. I was able to do with with the built-in functionality of the version of MS Word I was using at the time, but I don’t think it was truly a marco function rather than a hack that I created using the automatic spell corrector. </p>

<p>In college, it became even more handy. Instead of typing out long chemical names like Co<sub>1-x</sub>Ni<sub>x</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O or Fe[S<sub>2</sub>CN(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>Cl, I’d type CN2H or FSCCl. Not only did that save a lot of characters but it also saved me all the clicks in getting the subscript on the right characters.</p>

<p>In medicine, the problem is even more obvious. The combination of redundancy, complexity and speed make a text macro program a powerful ally.</p>

<h3 id="medical-application">Medical application</h3>

<p>The first macros I created were for the drugs and diseases I see all the time.</p>

<pre><code>.ra = rheumatoid arthritis
.psa = psoriatic arthritis
.sle = systemic lupus erythematosus 
.ssc systemic sclerosis
.oa = osteoarthrosis 

.pred = prednisone
.mtx = methotrexate 
.lef = leflunomide (Arava) 
.hcq = hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)
.hum = adalimumab (Humira)
.enb = etanercept (Enbrel)
.rit = rituximab (Rituxan) 
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how for some of the drugs I’ve included the brand name. This aides in clarity for the patient or non-rheumatologists who may not be as familiar with the generic names of the drugs. e.g. Rheumatologists typically use hydroxychloroquine but most patients know it as Plaquenil. When a patient leaves the office with my note, I don’t want them calling later to leave a message that they aren’t on that medication with the long name like my note says.</p>

<p>I can also use it to help me remember how to spell the drugs names or even remember some of the generics myself.</p>

<pre><code>.ken = triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog)
</code></pre>

<p>Even some non-drug words are just impossible to remember to spell correctly.</p>

<pre><code>.eyemd = ophthalmology
</code></pre>

<p>Occasionally, there are some weird labs whose abbreviations are non-standard but whose names are too weird to spell out every time.</p>

<pre><code>.la = lupus anticoagulant 
.acl = anticardiolipin antibody
.b2g = beta 2 glycoprotein antibody
</code></pre>

<p>I also don’t like typing out my physical exam findings, but this can be important for other doctors and audits.</p>

<pre><code>.rom = range of motion
.nrom = normal range of motion
.prom = passive range of motion
.arom = active range of motion
.rhsj = red, hot and/or swollen joints 
</code></pre>

<p>Now we start to pick up the pace a bit. I am frequently recommending that patients exercise, but they are far more likely to follow my instructions if I give concrete examples instead of vague platitudes.</p>

<pre><code>.exercise = Exercise by walking 30 minutes every day after dinner. 
    			http://youtu.be/aUaInS6HIGo
</code></pre>

<p>Coders love when I include the diagnostic codes with my assessment, especially for the weird (redundant?) rheumatology stuff.</p>

<pre><code>.dxra = Rheumatoid arthritis (714.00)
.dxia = Inflammatory polyarthropathy, unspecified (714.9)
.dxhrd = High Risk Drug (v58.69)
.dxea = Enteropathic arthritis (713.1)
</code></pre>

<p>Not infrequently, I want to impart a bit of knowledge to both the patient and the referring doctor. For example, in the case of a patient referred for a positive ANA or positive rheumatoid factor, it’s one thing to say they don’t have lupus or rheumatoid arthritis but it’s even better to explain what that damn tests means.</p>

<pre><code>.posana
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>A positive ANA does not diagnose an autoimmune disease nor does a negative result exclude it; however, ANA is positive in 99% of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus therefore a negative result strongly argues against such a diagnosis.  ANA can be positive by definition in 5% of the healthy population, typically in titers less than 1:320.  Up to 20% of healthy relatives of patients with rheumatic disease and up to 75% of healthy individuals older than 70 will have a positive ANA (typically less than 1:80 with a speckled or homogenous pattern).  Other conditions associated with a positive ANA are thyroid disease, chronic infections including TB/viral hepatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, malignancies, any of the auto-immune or connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis and patients with silicone breast implants.  In the absence of physical or biochemical evidence of pathology, a positive ANA is not clinically useful. </p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>.posrf
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many conditions can lead to a positive Rheumatoid Factor including chronic hepatic and pulmonary diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren’s, polymyositis, sarcoid, malignancies (especially after therapy), AIDS, mononucleosis, parasitic infections, chronic viral infections, tuberculosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, cryoglobulinemia, etc.  Frequency of positivity of rheumatoid factor in normal individuals also occurs and varies by age from 5% in those younger than 70 to 10-25% in those older than 70.  Changes in RF level do not reflect disease activity; however, a high titer does predict increased severity of disease including extra-articular manifestations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can even use this to remind me of recommendations on certain items. For example, I can never remember the exact recommendations from the BMJ on the duration of steroids for PMR.</p>

<pre><code>.bmjpmrsteroids

Daily prednisone 15 mg for 3 weeks
Then 12.5mg for 3 weeks
Then 10mg for 4–6 weeks
Then reduction by 1 mg every 4–8 weeks
</code></pre>

<p>Can’t remember the criteria for the diagnosis of Takayasu’s arteritis?</p>

<pre><code>.dxcTA
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Age at disease onset ≤40 years (Development of symptoms or findings related to Takayasu arteritis at age ≤ 40 years)    </li>
    <li>Claudication of extremities (Development and worsening of fatigue and discomfort in muscles of one or more extremity while in use, especially the upper extremities)</li>
    <li>Decreased brachial artery pulse (Decreased pulsation of one or both brachial arteries)</li>
    <li>BP difference &gt;10mmHg (Difference of &gt;10mmHg in systolic blood pressure between arms) </li>
    <li>Bruit over subclavian arteries or aorta (Bruit audible on auscultation over one or both subclavian arteries or abdominal aorta)</li>
    <li>Arteriogram abnormality (Arteriographic narrowing or occlusion of the entire aorta, its primary branches, or large arteries in the proximal upper or lower extremities, not due to arteriosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or similar causes; changes usually focal or segmental)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>3 of 6 required for diagnosis with a yield to 91% sensitivity and 98% specificity.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arend WP, Michel BA, Bloch DA, et al. The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of Takayasu arteritis. Arthritis Rheum 1990;33:1129–1132</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You look like a gunner on your note while making sure you remember the diagnostic criteria.</p>

<p>Of course, you can’t forget your note templates.</p>

<pre><code>.arthronote
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rheumatology Procedure Note</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Procedure: Arthrocentesis
Date of Service: %B %e, %Y<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consent: Verbal consent obtained from patient.<br />
Time Out: Yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Procedural Medications:  1% lidocaine, *** cc; *** 40mg/1ml, *** mg; *** Gebauer’s Spray</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Description of Procedure: After consent was obtained, the *** was prepped with betadine and alcohol.  Gebauer’s spray and plain 1% lidocaine was used as local anesthetic. The joint was entered and *** ml’s of *** colored fluid was withdrawn and sent for ***.  Steroid and Lidocaine were then injected and the needle withdrawn.  The procedure was well tolerated and hemostasis was obtained.  The attending physician was present for the entire procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The patient was asked to continue to rest the joint for a few more days before resuming regular activities and warned that it may be more painful for the first 1-2 days.  He/she was instructed to watch for fever, or increased swelling or persistent pain in the joint. Call or return to clinic prn if such symptoms occur or there is failure to improve as anticipated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See those strange characters after “Date of Service”? This is special code in TextExpander that automatically inserts that day’s date when the note is created. TextExpander has a lot more codes like this and others than can really power your macros. More on that in part 2.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hopefully, by now, I’ve convinced you that you can save a lot of time and stress by turning your frequently used words, phrases and templates into easy to type macros. In future posts, I will delve into some more advanced, yet easy to pick up, topics including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Special codes in TextExpander</li>
  <li>Syncing your macros across computers</li>
  <li>Keys to building and remembering your macros</li>
  <li>TextExpander on your iPhone and iPad.</li>
  <li>Ideas for macros </li>
  <li>Non-medical uses for TextExpander</li>
</ol>

<p>I will also answer some potential objections to my method, such as why you might want a text macro program if your EMR comes with templates (CPRS) or has a macro functionality (Epic).</p>

<p>If you have any specific questions or concerns you’d like addressed in the future posts, let me know.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/against-Centor-radiology-data">More data will not fix anything</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>Dr. Centor is optimistic about The American Journal of Medicine’s <a href="http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(11)00475-X/fulltext">Patient Centered Imaging</a> initiative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The secret to slowing down and even reversing the continuing increases in health costs will require many interventions.  We must use diagnostic tests more intelligently. <a href="http://www.medrants.com/archives/6674">→</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The premise seems to be that a lack of knowledge of the effectiveness of these tests is what causes them to be ordered when they are low yield. I would argue that be if from literature or experience, the low yield of these tests is well known to the ordering physicians and therefore this educational mission will do nothing to decrease their utilization. </p>

<p>Rather, I suspect that tests are overused for many reasons with the strongest being to avoid the possibility of a lawsuit. Sure, the likelihood of a CT of the head helping in a low impact cranial injury in a child is minimal, but if anything goes wrong, even if the CT scan wouldn’t have shown anything at the time it’s done, does anyone want to be the poor chap stuck at the defense table across from a parasitical lawyer and sympathetic family? Which do you want on your side, a crying, tragic mother wondering “what if” or a cold, sterile copy of the green journal?</p>

<p>Our society has no tolerance for the cruelty of random chance. When bad things happen, it must be due to malignant forces or criminal negligence. </p>

<p>I applaud the effort and look forward to the information, but I wouldn’t hold my breath for it to save any money, as proposed.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/value-of-emrs">The value of EMRs</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>Politics, money and the money of politics can ruin anything. In my life and work, they’ve ruined technology.</p>

<p>Clearly, I’m pro-tech. Of course, that’s only for tech that is good, that makes my life easier, that creates value, efficiency and quality. Tech that does not do this is bad and should be thrown away, or better yet, never bought in the first place.</p>

<p>It is part of the politics of the time that Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) or Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a panacea for all the problems in modern healthcare. Once everyone is using them, efficiency will increase, errors will decrease, massive amounts of money will be saved, the lion will lay down with the lamb and pink unicorns will have rainbow farts.</p>

<p>Except, the current EMRs are so horribly designed and beholden to some many asinine governmental requirements that the exact opposite is occurring. (I know, pink zombies with sulfur farts—it’s terrifying.) The the immense amount of pressure from the payers in medicine (that’s the insurance companies and the government, not the patients) to implement them is resulting is massive amounts of wasted money.</p>

<p>Here’s just one example, from <a href="http://throckmortonsothersigns.blogspot.com/2012/01/de-access.html">Throckmorton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has decreased the numbers patients that can be see in a clinic by 30%. Even with that reduction, the clinic runs an extra hour and half longer. The actual time of patient contact, defined as listening, examining, and answering questions has been decreased by 50%.. We have had to hire 2 new assistants for every three doctors. We are told that it would improve our coding and because of this it would be cost neutral. As of today, it has decreased productivity and only added to overhead for a cost to the practice of 112k per physician. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminded me of a quote from Steve Jobs in Wired from 1996 regarding education that I think is perfectly applicable to the situation here as many of the same problems in medicine and education are similar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I used to think that technology could help education. I’ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I’ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What’s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a political problem. The problems are sociopolitical. The problems are unions. You plot the growth of the NEA [National Education Association] and the dropping of SAT scores, and they’re inversely proportional. The problems are unions in the schools. <strong>The problem is bureaucracy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problems in medicine are because powerful bureaucracies continue to create mountains of red-tape and mandates purporting to fix problems while only making them worse.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>I want you to learn two things from this email. The first (the fish) is how to combine multiple open Safari windows into one window with multiple tabs. The second (how to fish) is about becoming self-sufficient and making your life better.</p>

<h3 id="the-fish">The Fish</h3>

<p>Safari has an option to “Merge All Windows”. On the menu bar go to Window &gt; Merge All Windows. Simple.</p>

<p>Even better, you can create a shortcut for this.</p>

<p>Open System Preferences (command-spacebar, type “System”), click on Keyboard, choose Keyboard Shortcuts, choose Application Shortcuts, click the “+” button. Under Application: choose Safari. Under Menu title: Type “Merge All Windows”. Under Keyboard Shortcut: press shift + option + command + m. Click add.</p>

<p>Now, whenever you have a bunch of Safari windows open, just hit shift + option + command + m. (It’s a lot easier than it sounds.)</p>

<h3 id="how-to-fish">How to fish</h3>

<p>I always end up with a million browser windows open, each with several open tabs in them. Frequently, they have the same mail, calendar, Google reader and log in to my EMR websites pulled up on them. Typically this happens when I click on a link in the first window and it opens the link in a new browser window, then later, with that window on top, I want my email and open a new tab to go to it, even though the same site is open in a different window that’s hidden. </p>

<p>I thought two things: windows should always open in a new tab and there should be a way to easily merge all these windows together. <em>I wish I could say that I immediately Google’d it and figured it out.</em> Unfortunately, I’ve been thinking about this for months and never bothered to do anything about it. This has happened to me more times than is healthy. I need to just learn that when I have a problem, there’s probably a solution already created.</p>

<p>For the first step, go to the menu bar: Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Tabs. Under “Open pages in tabs instead of windows:” choose automatically. For the second step, I explained the second part above.</p>

<p><strong>Moral</strong>: There is almost always an easy way to do something on a Mac. If you want to do something, Google for how to do it.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/not-a-mute-switch">Not-a-mute switch</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>Some guy writes an articles in the New York Times because his iPhone alarm goes off during a concert, causing him significant embarrassment.<sup id="fnref:1201150901"><a href="#fn:1201150901" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Words used to described the situation in the NYT included <em>shame, jarring, angry, vitriol and devastating</em>. The apparent “culprit” claimed he was so traumatized he hadn’t slept for 2 days.<sup id="fnref:1201150902"><a href="#fn:1201150902" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>As unimportant as this event was, except as a object lesson that we should be careful to value the opinion of New Yorkers on anything, it did spark off more blog posts in the community on a single issue than I think even occurred with. Even <a href="http://hivelogic.com">Hivelogic</a> came out of the mothballs.</p>

<p>It seems that <a href="http://www.biancolo.com/articles/bad-ui-stops-symphony">everyone</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/01/iphone_mute_switch_design">of</a> <a href="http://ihnatko.com/2012/01/14/daring-fireball-on-the-behavior-of-the-iphone-mute-switch/">note</a> <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/01/14/mute">has</a> <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/01/mute/">had</a> <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/mute/">something</a> to say on the issue.</p>

<p>Since I now find myself <em>devastated</em> by the whole situation, jarred out of my <em>complacent</em> lifestyle by all the <em>vitriolic</em> writings and overwhelmed with <em>shame</em> that my favorite device, I thought I should gather the <em>courage</em> to add a few points that seem to have been missed.</p>

<p>For those not wanting to go through all the above posts<sup id="fnref:1201150909"><a href="#fn:1201150909" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, the short version is that the so-called “Mute” switch on the side of the iPhone is actually called the “Ring/Silent switch” and does not actually mute the phone completely, allowing songs, videos, games and alarms to make nose, presumably on the premise that these are items that the user has specifically stated they want to make noise.</p>

<p>There have been many good points made both for and against this current behavior:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s much better to be upset with yourself for having done something stupid than to be upset with a device that made the wrong decision on its own initiative. - <a href="http://ihnatko.com/2012/01/14/daring-fireball-on-the-behavior-of-the-iphone-mute-switch/">Andy Ihnatko</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The user has issued conflicting commands, and the iPhone can’t obey both. - <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/01/14/mute">Marco Arment</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[W]hen I go to bed at night, I want to know that my alarm will wake me, but that my drunk friends won’t. - <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/01/mute/">Ben Brooks</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see two main arguments here:</p>

<p><strong>Philosophical argument</strong>: Alarms are important and are explicitly set. They should go off no matter what because folks will forget they muted their phone the night before, miss their alarm and get fired for being late. This will occur much more frequently than some dilitante getting socially castrated because of his alarm going off doing the <em>sublime</em> section of Mahler.</p>

<p><strong>Practical argument</strong>: When you activate the mute switch you have the expectation that the phone won’t make any noise, ever, like on every other phone on the market. If you forget to undo it, that’s your own damn fault. Grown a pair.</p>

<p>I’ve suffered the negative consequences from both of the above, and really can’t say which is worse. I think both sides have made very good points and I don’t see a clear winner here. Each time I read a new post, I start to agree with that one.<sup id="fnref:1201150930"><a href="#fn:1201150930" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="missing-factor">Missing Factor</h3>

<p>But then Ben Brooks <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/01/the-picture-says-it-all/">pointed out</a> something this morning that got me thinking. He noted that the image displayed on the screen when you flip the not-a-mute switch looks different than the image when you press the volume buttons. For example, the first image below is using the not-a-mute switch while the second one is using the volume buttons:</p>

<p><img src="/images/iPhone_4_mute_switch.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/iPhone_4_ringer_on.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>This prompted me to check something I vaguely remembered—you can’t turn off the volume completely using the volume buttons. Here is the same symbol with the volume turned as low as possible using the volume buttons:</p>

<p><img src="/images/iPhone_4_ringer_off.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>There is still one box of volume remaining. I also remembered that this didn’t seem to always be the case. I know that I’ve turned the volume down all the way before. Was it on a previous iPhone? Or was it on my first generation iPod Touch that I had to use before  <del>my wife let me buy</del> <ins>I bought</ins> a real iPhone?</p>

<p>I ripped my son’s 4th generation iPod Touch from his death grip<sup id="fnref:1201151006"><a href="#fn:1201151006" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and put it to the test. The first thing I noticed is that the symbol is not labeled ringer, but sound effects:</p>

<p><img src="/images/iPod_Touch_volume_on.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Also, you can turn the volume all the way off:</p>

<p><img src="/images/iPod_Touch_volume_off.PNG" alt="" /></p>

<p>So I set an alarm, turned off the volume and waited…</p>

<p>…silence…</p>

<p><em>The alarm triggered, the screen turned on, but no sound or vibration occurred.</em></p>

<p>It turns out that the controversial behavior appears to be unique to the iPhone and is not the same on the iPod Touch, aka John Siracusa’s iPhone. The iPod Touch has no mute switch. The volume buttons control the “sound effects”. You can turn the volume off completely, which does silence the alarms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don’t think that this solves the problem. I would probably like it made so that the mute switch works like on every other phone, completely silencing everything, but that if I turn the volume all the way down using the volume keys, it could go all the way off, silencing only the ringer, but allowing alarms to play. Basically, I would have both the Philosophical and Practical options available to me</p>

<p>But this seems to be a solution for a tech-savy nerd and not a solution for grandma, and therefore is a fail.</p>

<p>Many have pointed out that there should be options for the different behavior in the settings and while I generally agree with this, it doesn’t answer the general user issue of what should be the default behavior.</p>

<p>At least now I am aware of the situation and less likely to make a mistake in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: My wife weighs in and, as all husbands know, is the final authority.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The mute switch should silence everything—no exceptions.</li>
  <li>People who have to get up at a certain time should be paranoid enough to verify their alarm’s settings.</li>
  <li>There should be many options in the settings to allow you to customize this in detail.</li>
