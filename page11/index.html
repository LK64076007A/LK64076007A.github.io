<p>Sure, you can whine about being ass-raped in prison, but since when have people not been getting ass raped in prison?</p>

<p>What Dan fails to appreciate is that AT&amp;T used its “unlimited data” to get customers and lock them into a contract. Then, when those same customers want the terms of their contract enforced, they balk. </p>

<p>Even little kids have a strong ingrained sense of fairness, and this clearly isn’t fair. Which leads to strong negative emotions. Which leads to customers leaving.</p>

<p>I guess that’s one thing Dan gets correct:</p>

      <div class="content"><p>A drug rep stopped by today and asked about my use of her companies drug. Using my chart system, in less than 30 seconds, I was able to determine that no patient of mine is currently on their drug, one has failed it in the past and one person might be starting it soon.</p>

<p>This is not possible with any EMR I have previously used to have access to now, but is one of the things always touted as a great benefit of EMRs.</p>

<p>My system is electronic. My system is secure. My system is fast. My system is electronic.</p>

<p>But it is not a certified, legacy system that costs tens of thousands of dollars. It costs less than $2000. And that’s mostly for the Macbook Air.</p>

<p>My system makes me happy and helps me provide quality care. It is not certified for Meaningful Use, but I’ll bet you a month’s pay that I use mine much more meaningfully than any EMR out there.</p>

<p>It also makes me happy.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>Is there a name for the psychological phenomena in which people in one culture seem to think that ideas attributed to another culture are magically special, even if those same ideas already exist and are not recognized in the first culture?</p>

<p>For example, how exactly is this a “French” way of raising kids?</p>

<p><a href="http://kottke.org/12/02/how-to-parent-like-the-french">Jason Kottke</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One of the keys to this education is the simple act of learning how to wait. It is why the French babies I meet mostly sleep through the night from two or three months old. Their parents don’t pick them up the second they start crying, allowing the babies to learn how to fall back asleep. It is also why French toddlers will sit happily at a restaurant. Rather than snacking all day like American children, they mostly have to wait until mealtime to eat. (French kids consistently have three meals a day and one snack around 4 p.m.)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have a French pediatrician who advised us to do almost exactly what is in this article and we’ve had pretty good success with it. It’s not all roses (kids are kids after all) and a lot of work, especially for the first couple of years, because you have to be consistent and steady and firm (but also flexible) and I know I haven’t always done a great job, but the dividends have been totally worth it so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s exactly how I raise my kid. And I never read any stupid book or talked to a pediatrician about it. Seems like a pretty standard old-fashioned way of doing things. </p>
