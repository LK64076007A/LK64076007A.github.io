  <p>Sure, you can whine about the promise that AT&amp;T made you many years ago when you signed up for unlimited data. But when has a gigantic telecom company actually failed to disappoint you? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, you can whine about being ass-raped in prison, but since when have people not been getting ass raped in prison?</p>

<p>What Dan fails to appreciate is that AT&amp;T used its “unlimited data” to get customers and lock them into a contract. Then, when those same customers want the terms of their contract enforced, they balk. </p>

<p>Even little kids have a strong ingrained sense of fairness, and this clearly isn’t fair. Which leads to strong negative emotions. Which leads to customers leaving.</p>

<p>I guess that’s one thing Dan gets correct:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Y]ou can switch to Sprint</p>

<p>Coincidentally, a friend of mine got the AT&amp;T throttling warning this morning. He’s decided to leave.</p>

<p><strong>Update: I’ve switched to Sprint.</strong></p>

      <div class="content"><p>A drug rep stopped by today and asked about my use of her companies drug. Using my chart system, in less than 30 seconds, I was able to determine that no patient of mine is currently on their drug, one has failed it in the past and one person might be starting it soon.</p>

<p>This is not possible with any EMR I have previously used to have access to now, but is one of the things always touted as a great benefit of EMRs.</p>

<p>My system is electronic. My system is secure. My system is fast. My system is electronic.</p>

<p>But it is not a certified, legacy system that costs tens of thousands of dollars. It costs less than $2000. And that’s mostly for the Macbook Air.</p>

<p>My system makes me happy and helps me provide quality care. It is not certified for Meaningful Use, but I’ll bet you a month’s pay that I use mine much more meaningfully than any EMR out there.</p>

<p>It also makes me happy.</p>

<p>I hope to share my workflow with you someday.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>Is there a name for the psychological phenomena in which people in one culture seem to think that ideas attributed to another culture are magically special, even if those same ideas already exist and are not recognized in the first culture?</p>

<p>For example, how exactly is this a “French” way of raising kids?</p>

<p><a href="http://kottke.org/12/02/how-to-parent-like-the-french">Jason Kottke</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>One of the keys to this education is the simple act of learning how to wait. It is why the French babies I meet mostly sleep through the night from two or three months old. Their parents don’t pick them up the second they start crying, allowing the babies to learn how to fall back asleep. It is also why French toddlers will sit happily at a restaurant. Rather than snacking all day like American children, they mostly have to wait until mealtime to eat. (French kids consistently have three meals a day and one snack around 4 p.m.)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have a French pediatrician who advised us to do almost exactly what is in this article and we’ve had pretty good success with it. It’s not all roses (kids are kids after all) and a lot of work, especially for the first couple of years, because you have to be consistent and steady and firm (but also flexible) and I know I haven’t always done a great job, but the dividends have been totally worth it so far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s exactly how I raise my kid. And I never read any stupid book or talked to a pediatrician about it. Seems like a pretty standard old-fashioned way of doing things. </p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/TextExpander-for-physicians-part-2">TextExpander for physicians, Part 2</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>In part 1, I tried to explain what TextExpander was and why a physician might want to use it as a force multiplier by showing a few examples of macros that I use daily.</p>

<p><a href="/TextExpander-for-physicians-part-1">TextExpander for physicians, Part 1</a></p>

<p>In part 2, I will cover special codes, syncing between computers, and iOS apps.</p>

<h2 id="special-codes">Special codes</h2>

<h3 id="time-and-date">Time and Date</h3>

<p>Special codes are text you can put into a macro that tells TextExpander to do something other than just type out the characters. The simplest example is their Time/Date codes. Inside the macro that creates my consult note template is some characters that automatically inserts that day’s date into the note. Instead of having to type, and remember, the date every time I start a new note, the macro does it for me. <code>ddate = %B %e, %Y = February 1, 2012</code> There are numerous permutations of this code so you can create the date however you want.</p>

<p>Time codes are also helpful at times. There are many codes to document the time exactly as you might need it but the built in macro that comes pre-created is <code>time = %1I:%M %p = 9:04 PM</code>. I have discovered two useful cases for this. The first is documenting how much time I spend on a patient and how much of that time is in counseling and coordination. Keeping track of time is only going to happen if it’s easy. This macro makes it very easy. As I walk into a room, I tap the code “ttime”. When I finish the history and exam, while the patient is getting their clothes back on and I’m finishing up my note, I hit it again, “ttime”. And when I’m done with my counseling I hit it a final time. Now I know how long my visit was and if over 50% of that time was in counseling. This allows me to track my time spent per patient so I can better plan my schedule. If I’m taking 20 minutes per patient, but only scheduling 15 minutes, obviously I need to change my schedule. Also, if over 50% of my time is in counseling, then I can bill by time rather than by the traditional coding levels.</p>

<p>I’ve also used this lately to keep track of how long it takes to make phone calls to patients. I’ve been surprised how long the typical call lasts and by having this data, I can more accurately plan my schedule, bill and allocate resources.</p>

<p>TextExpander also comes with some codes for date and time math. Most of my follow ups and planning takes place at regular intervals: every 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks, 12 months or 24 months. This may apply to the next follow up appointment, lab check, infusion time, TB test or DXA scan. While it is easy to say “follow up for labs in 8 weeks”, this abstractness appears to be poorly mentally processed. Being more concrete fixes this problem.</p>

<pre><code>.8wfu = Follow up in 8 weeks (around March 28, 2012). 
</code></pre>

<p>More complicated structures wouldn’t be that difficult to create.</p>

<pre><code>.inrchecks = Check INR on 2/4/12, 2/7/12, 2/10/12, and 2/13/12 (Monday).
</code></pre>

<p>All the dates and the day of the week in that last macro are automatically calculated.</p>

<p>Are you a hospitalist with a patient needs neurochecks every 4 hours?</p>

<pre><code>.q4nchecks = Neuro checks q4 hours (01:33, 05:33, 09:33, 13:33, 17:33, 21:33). 
</code></pre>

<h3 id="fill-ins">Fill ins</h3>

<p>Another special code is the fill in. <code>%fill:name%</code>. This has the macro prompt you to enter text that will be inserted into the text when the macro is created. For example, you might have a macro that prompts for a follow up time.</p>

<pre><code>.fut = Return to clinic in %fill:numberofweeks% weeks.
</code></pre>

<p>This creates the following prompt:</p>

<p><a href="/images/textexpander_fut.png"><img src="/images/textexpander_fut.png" alt="fill in prompt" /></a> </p>

<p>Enter the desired time:</p>

<p><a href="/images/textexpander_fut_2.png"><img src="/images/textexpander_fut_2.png" alt="macro filled in" /></a> </p>

<p>Hit “enter” and your text appears:</p>

<p><a href="/images/textexpander_fut_3.png"><img src="/images/textexpander_fut_3.png" alt="Macro completes" /></a>  </p>

<p>I use this all the time for form letters and consult note templates. For each different fill in, you need to change “name” in <code>%fill:name%</code> to a unique identifier. Or, if you leave it the same, whatever you put in one place, will appear in all the others with the same phrase. For example, in my consult note, I don’t have to retype the patient’s name, consulting physician or reason for consult/chief complaint:</p>

<p><a href="/images/consultnote_macro.png"><img src="/images/consultnote_macro.png" alt="consult note macro" /></a> </p>

<h3 id="copy-clipboard">Copy clipboard</h3>

<p>Another special code is the “clipboard”, <code>%clipboard</code>. This inserts whatever is copied to your clipboard. I use this more for non-medical uses, like writing code or html but the one place I use it regularly in medicine is when saving my notes to file. I use a file name structure that is “Patient Name” and “date of visit.” Using the code <code>%clipboard %1m.%e.%Y</code> and making sure to copy (Command-C) the name from my note to the clipboard before keying the macro, I save a lot of time saving files.</p>

<pre><code>.nd = James Bond 2.1.2012.pages
</code></pre>

<h3 id="cursor-placement">Cursor placement</h3>

<p>The final special code I’ll mention is the cursor placement. <code>%|</code> (That’s percent pipe.) puts your cursor wherever you want with in the text that the macro creates. For short macros, this isn’t needed, but when I use my consult note template, I don’t need the cursor at the end of the document, requiring me to scroll back up to the first page to start typing. Instead, I place it in the History of present illness, so I can start typing what the patient is telling me immediately:</p>

<p><a href="/images/James_Bond_note.png"><img src="/images/James_Bond_note.png" alt="James Bonds note" /></a> </p>

<p>It’s a little thing, but you add up all the little things and the time and convenience are incredible.</p>

<h2 id="syncing-between-computers">Syncing between computers</h2>

<p>Once you have created a lot of macros, your library is going to become a valuable commodity. You will become dependent on these macros and feel lost without them. You will want to make sure you back up your library as well as have it available on any computer you may use. Thankfully, the developers of TextExpander have enabled backing up and syncing of your library through <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. If you don’t know what Dropbox is<sup id="fnref:1202012211"><a href="#fn:1202012211" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, stop reading immediately and go get it. </p>

<p>Now that you have Dropbox and have enabled syncing in the preferences of the TextExpander app, your library of macros will auto-magically appear on any computer<sup id="fnref:1202012213"><a href="#fn:1202012213" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that you’ve also synced using Dropbox. This also works with the iPhone and iPad versions of the applications.</p>

<p>In fact, I have a friend who writes all his clinic notes in TextExpander Touch on his iPad using a bluetooth keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="ios-apps">iOS apps</h2>

<p>TextExpander Touch, the version of the app available for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, is quite good as well, but a bit limited due to restrictions of the operating system. The main restriction is that you cannot use the app to expand text just anywhere in iOS. TextExpander Touch will only work in apps that are specifically enabled to use it. Thankfully, there are a lot of <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/touch/apps/">those apps</a>. The apps also have a built in text editor, so you can write notes there and then copy and paste them or email them elsewhere. It is slightly limiting but nice to have. I tend to use this more for taking notes in meetings and at dinner meetings, when taking out a laptop—even one as small as a Macbook Air—would be overly distracting to others.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, that’s enough for tonight. In the next, and hopefully final, part, I will finish up by laying out ideas for macros to use in your practice, keys to creating shortcuts you can remember, non-medical uses of macros and advantages of a stand alone applications versus the built-in functionality that some EMRs have.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/TextExpander-for-physicians-part-1">TextExpander for physicians, Part 1</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>As a physician I write a lot.<sup id="fnref:1201301814"><a href="#fn:1201301814" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Most of my writing is the same or similar to things I’ve written before and will write again. Repeatedly typing the same things character by character is a waste of time, energy and cartilage. In order to turn my 70 word per minute<sup id="fnref:1201302145"><a href="#fn:1201302145" class="footnote">2</a></sup> into hundreds of words per minute without ended up as a patient myself, I engage a force multiplier, TextExpander.</p>

<p>TextExpander is a text macro program. Simply put, you type a few characters and the program outputs quite a bit more characters. In the last 6 months of use, it’s saved me from typing over 1/2 a million characters, saving an estimated 24 hours of time based on 70 words per minute or at a more typical physician rate of 40 words per minutes, it’s saved me almost 2 solid days of typing.</p>

<p>But like all beautiful things there’s so much more than that.</p>

<h3 id="personal-history">Personal history</h3>

<p>I’ve been using text macros since junior high school. When writing a history day paper, instead of typing “Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry”, I typed CMCP and the whole name would spring forth. I was able to do with with the built-in functionality of the version of MS Word I was using at the time, but I don’t think it was truly a marco function rather than a hack that I created using the automatic spell corrector. </p>

<p>In college, it became even more handy. Instead of typing out long chemical names like Co<sub>1-x</sub>Ni<sub>x</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O or Fe[S<sub>2</sub>CN(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>Cl, I’d type CN2H or FSCCl. Not only did that save a lot of characters but it also saved me all the clicks in getting the subscript on the right characters.</p>

<p>In medicine, the problem is even more obvious. The combination of redundancy, complexity and speed make a text macro program a powerful ally.</p>

<h3 id="medical-application">Medical application</h3>

<p>The first macros I created were for the drugs and diseases I see all the time.</p>

<pre><code>.ra = rheumatoid arthritis
.psa = psoriatic arthritis
.sle = systemic lupus erythematosus 
.ssc systemic sclerosis
.oa = osteoarthrosis 

.pred = prednisone
.mtx = methotrexate 
.lef = leflunomide (Arava) 
.hcq = hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)
.hum = adalimumab (Humira)
.enb = etanercept (Enbrel)
.rit = rituximab (Rituxan) 
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how for some of the drugs I’ve included the brand name. This aides in clarity for the patient or non-rheumatologists who may not be as familiar with the generic names of the drugs. e.g. Rheumatologists typically use hydroxychloroquine but most patients know it as Plaquenil. When a patient leaves the office with my note, I don’t want them calling later to leave a message that they aren’t on that medication with the long name like my note says.</p>

<p>I can also use it to help me remember how to spell the drugs names or even remember some of the generics myself.</p>

<pre><code>.ken = triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog)
</code></pre>

<p>Even some non-drug words are just impossible to remember to spell correctly.</p>

<pre><code>.eyemd = ophthalmology
</code></pre>

<p>Occasionally, there are some weird labs whose abbreviations are non-standard but whose names are too weird to spell out every time.</p>

<pre><code>.la = lupus anticoagulant 
.acl = anticardiolipin antibody
.b2g = beta 2 glycoprotein antibody
</code></pre>

<p>I also don’t like typing out my physical exam findings, but this can be important for other doctors and audits.</p>

<pre><code>.rom = range of motion
.nrom = normal range of motion
.prom = passive range of motion
.arom = active range of motion
.rhsj = red, hot and/or swollen joints 
</code></pre>

<p>Now we start to pick up the pace a bit. I am frequently recommending that patients exercise, but they are far more likely to follow my instructions if I give concrete examples instead of vague platitudes.</p>

<pre><code>.exercise = Exercise by walking 30 minutes every day after dinner. 
    			http://youtu.be/aUaInS6HIGo
</code></pre>

<p>Coders love when I include the diagnostic codes with my assessment, especially for the weird (redundant?) rheumatology stuff.</p>

<pre><code>.dxra = Rheumatoid arthritis (714.00)
.dxia = Inflammatory polyarthropathy, unspecified (714.9)
.dxhrd = High Risk Drug (v58.69)
.dxea = Enteropathic arthritis (713.1)
</code></pre>

<p>Not infrequently, I want to impart a bit of knowledge to both the patient and the referring doctor. For example, in the case of a patient referred for a positive ANA or positive rheumatoid factor, it’s one thing to say they don’t have lupus or rheumatoid arthritis but it’s even better to explain what that damn tests means.</p>

<pre><code>.posana
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>A positive ANA does not diagnose an autoimmune disease nor does a negative result exclude it; however, ANA is positive in 99% of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus therefore a negative result strongly argues against such a diagnosis.  ANA can be positive by definition in 5% of the healthy population, typically in titers less than 1:320.  Up to 20% of healthy relatives of patients with rheumatic disease and up to 75% of healthy individuals older than 70 will have a positive ANA (typically less than 1:80 with a speckled or homogenous pattern).  Other conditions associated with a positive ANA are thyroid disease, chronic infections including TB/viral hepatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, malignancies, any of the auto-immune or connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis and patients with silicone breast implants.  In the absence of physical or biochemical evidence of pathology, a positive ANA is not clinically useful. </p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>.posrf
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many conditions can lead to a positive Rheumatoid Factor including chronic hepatic and pulmonary diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren’s, polymyositis, sarcoid, malignancies (especially after therapy), AIDS, mononucleosis, parasitic infections, chronic viral infections, tuberculosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, cryoglobulinemia, etc.  Frequency of positivity of rheumatoid factor in normal individuals also occurs and varies by age from 5% in those younger than 70 to 10-25% in those older than 70.  Changes in RF level do not reflect disease activity; however, a high titer does predict increased severity of disease including extra-articular manifestations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can even use this to remind me of recommendations on certain items. For example, I can never remember the exact recommendations from the BMJ on the duration of steroids for PMR.</p>

<pre><code>.bmjpmrsteroids

Daily prednisone 15 mg for 3 weeks
Then 12.5mg for 3 weeks
Then 10mg for 4–6 weeks
Then reduction by 1 mg every 4–8 weeks
</code></pre>

<p>Can’t remember the criteria for the diagnosis of Takayasu’s arteritis?</p>

<pre><code>.dxcTA
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Age at disease onset ≤40 years (Development of symptoms or findings related to Takayasu arteritis at age ≤ 40 years)    </li>
    <li>Claudication of extremities (Development and worsening of fatigue and discomfort in muscles of one or more extremity while in use, especially the upper extremities)</li>
    <li>Decreased brachial artery pulse (Decreased pulsation of one or both brachial arteries)</li>
    <li>BP difference &gt;10mmHg (Difference of &gt;10mmHg in systolic blood pressure between arms) </li>
    <li>Bruit over subclavian arteries or aorta (Bruit audible on auscultation over one or both subclavian arteries or abdominal aorta)</li>
    <li>Arteriogram abnormality (Arteriographic narrowing or occlusion of the entire aorta, its primary branches, or large arteries in the proximal upper or lower extremities, not due to arteriosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or similar causes; changes usually focal or segmental)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>3 of 6 required for diagnosis with a yield to 91% sensitivity and 98% specificity.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arend WP, Michel BA, Bloch DA, et al. The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of Takayasu arteritis. Arthritis Rheum 1990;33:1129–1132</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You look like a gunner on your note while making sure you remember the diagnostic criteria.</p>

<p>Of course, you can’t forget your note templates.</p>

<pre><code>.arthronote
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rheumatology Procedure Note</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Procedure: Arthrocentesis
Date of Service: %B %e, %Y<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consent: Verbal consent obtained from patient.<br />
Time Out: Yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Procedural Medications:  1% lidocaine, *** cc; *** 40mg/1ml, *** mg; *** Gebauer’s Spray</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Description of Procedure: After consent was obtained, the *** was prepped with betadine and alcohol.  Gebauer’s spray and plain 1% lidocaine was used as local anesthetic. The joint was entered and *** ml’s of *** colored fluid was withdrawn and sent for ***.  Steroid and Lidocaine were then injected and the needle withdrawn.  The procedure was well tolerated and hemostasis was obtained.  The attending physician was present for the entire procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The patient was asked to continue to rest the joint for a few more days before resuming regular activities and warned that it may be more painful for the first 1-2 days.  He/she was instructed to watch for fever, or increased swelling or persistent pain in the joint. Call or return to clinic prn if such symptoms occur or there is failure to improve as anticipated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See those strange characters after “Date of Service”? This is special code in TextExpander that automatically inserts that day’s date when the note is created. TextExpander has a lot more codes like this and others than can really power your macros. More on that in part 2.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hopefully, by now, I’ve convinced you that you can save a lot of time and stress by turning your frequently used words, phrases and templates into easy to type macros. In future posts, I will delve into some more advanced, yet easy to pick up, topics including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Special codes in TextExpander</li>
  <li>Syncing your macros across computers</li>
  <li>Keys to building and remembering your macros</li>
  <li>TextExpander on your iPhone and iPad.</li>
  <li>Ideas for macros </li>
  <li>Non-medical uses for TextExpander</li>
</ol>

<p>I will also answer some potential objections to my method, such as why you might want a text macro program if your EMR comes with templates (CPRS) or has a macro functionality (Epic).</p>

<p>If you have any specific questions or concerns you’d like addressed in the future posts, let me know.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/against-Centor-radiology-data">More data will not fix anything</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>Dr. Centor is optimistic about The American Journal of Medicine’s <a href="http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(11)00475-X/fulltext">Patient Centered Imaging</a> initiative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The secret to slowing down and even reversing the continuing increases in health costs will require many interventions.  We must use diagnostic tests more intelligently. <a href="http://www.medrants.com/archives/6674">→</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The premise seems to be that a lack of knowledge of the effectiveness of these tests is what causes them to be ordered when they are low yield. I would argue that be if from literature or experience, the low yield of these tests is well known to the ordering physicians and therefore this educational mission will do nothing to decrease their utilization. </p>

<p>Rather, I suspect that tests are overused for many reasons with the strongest being to avoid the possibility of a lawsuit. Sure, the likelihood of a CT of the head helping in a low impact cranial injury in a child is minimal, but if anything goes wrong, even if the CT scan wouldn’t have shown anything at the time it’s done, does anyone want to be the poor chap stuck at the defense table across from a parasitical lawyer and sympathetic family? Which do you want on your side, a crying, tragic mother wondering “what if” or a cold, sterile copy of the green journal?</p>

<p>Our society has no tolerance for the cruelty of random chance. When bad things happen, it must be due to malignant forces or criminal negligence. </p>

<p>I applaud the effort and look forward to the information, but I wouldn’t hold my breath for it to save any money, as proposed.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/value-of-emrs">The value of EMRs</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>Politics, money and the money of politics can ruin anything. In my life and work, they’ve ruined technology.</p>

<p>Clearly, I’m pro-tech. Of course, that’s only for tech that is good, that makes my life easier, that creates value, efficiency and quality. Tech that does not do this is bad and should be thrown away, or better yet, never bought in the first place.</p>

<p>It is part of the politics of the time that Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) or Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are a panacea for all the problems in modern healthcare. Once everyone is using them, efficiency will increase, errors will decrease, massive amounts of money will be saved, the lion will lay down with the lamb and pink unicorns will have rainbow farts.</p>

<p>Except, the current EMRs are so horribly designed and beholden to some many asinine governmental requirements that the exact opposite is occurring. (I know, pink zombies with sulfur farts—it’s terrifying.) The the immense amount of pressure from the payers in medicine (that’s the insurance companies and the government, not the patients) to implement them is resulting is massive amounts of wasted money.</p>

<p>Here’s just one example, from <a href="http://throckmortonsothersigns.blogspot.com/2012/01/de-access.html">Throckmorton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has decreased the numbers patients that can be see in a clinic by 30%. Even with that reduction, the clinic runs an extra hour and half longer. The actual time of patient contact, defined as listening, examining, and answering questions has been decreased by 50%.. We have had to hire 2 new assistants for every three doctors. We are told that it would improve our coding and because of this it would be cost neutral. As of today, it has decreased productivity and only added to overhead for a cost to the practice of 112k per physician. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reminded me of a quote from Steve Jobs in Wired from 1996 regarding education that I think is perfectly applicable to the situation here as many of the same problems in medicine and education are similar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I used to think that technology could help education. I’ve probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I’ve had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What’s wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a political problem. The problems are sociopolitical. The problems are unions. You plot the growth of the NEA [National Education Association] and the dropping of SAT scores, and they’re inversely proportional. The problems are unions in the schools. <strong>The problem is bureaucracy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problems in medicine are because powerful bureaucracies continue to create mountains of red-tape and mandates purporting to fix problems while only making them worse.</p>
