      <div class="content"><p>I’ve been wanting TextExpander for awhile and was going to buy it when I got around to it.</p>

<p>For the next 15 days it’s being <a href="http://www.productivemacs.com/f/75354">sold in a bundle</a> with 7 other Mac apps for five dollars less than it’s normal price ($30). You also get a bunch of other great productivity and social apps like Keyboard Maestro. </p>

<p>If you want to be a power user, or you have to because you use computers for a living, i.e. physician, than you need good macro programs.</p>

<p>Don’t know why? Make all your disease information, frequent prescriptions and operative notes/instructions into macros. It’s a lot easier to type OA and have all my osteoarthritis information pop up than to type it fresh each time or even copy and paste it.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>I love technology.  A few new items have come into my life lately I’d like to share.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile Google Maps.  This is a program that runs on your mobile.  It accesses the GPS unit on the mobile and uses that data for location and direction functionality.  It also interfaces with google maps,  google satellites and other online mapping images.Most mobile phones these days have GPS functionality and a few companies have created interfaces with this information and for a price allow limited access.   (This is in the US where the mobile industry is in the freaking dark ages.)  This program gives more functionality for free.</li>
</ul>

<p>A neat feature about this is the ability to remotely view the mobile’s current location online when the program is active or its last position before the program was turned off. </p>

<p>I’ve gotten back into Geocaching lately because of this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Next up is Opera Mini 3.0.  This is a web browser for mobile phones.  I’ve been using version 2.0 for awhile now.  The new version has several significant improvements including nesting of long lists (no more long scrolls through people’s bloglists of 100 sites etc.), photo uploads, smaller text and secure sign ins.  For the first time, I’m also able to log into the wordpress site and blog through my mobile.  My last few post were done that way.</li>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/why-windows-sucks">Why I Hate Windows</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I love macs.  Sadly, I use Windows the most.  This is because 1) my mac died, 2) I won an HP laptop in a contest, 3) I’m too poor to buy a computer (or even pay the $500 I’m told it will cost to fix my ibook) and 4) all the hospitals I work at use win boxes.  The following is a story of my hell and something that would NEVER happen on a mac.</p>

<p>About a week ago my laptop became infected with a virus or two hundred when I visited a website.  I know this because google warned me it might contain malware and I went there anyway and as soon as I did my practically worthless virus program (Sophos) started screaming about infected files, but was unable to DO anything about it.  Meanwhile all sorts of pop ups, adware, and internet explorer toolbars started ravaging my system.</p>

<p>I installed a few other programs that were able to find and delete most of them, but the pop ups continued, more files continued to be infected, crashes became status quo and I wanted to smash the laptop with a hammer.  I had done everything I could to halt the damage, even trying system restore, which kept failing to restore, without success.  Finally today, on my day off, I reformatted the HD and reloaded everything.  Actually, I’m still reloading everything.</p>

<p>Thankfully, all my music was on my iPod, so I can port that back over (illegally?) and all of my pictures, documents etc. are also saved on usb drives.  I did lose some videos and am wasting hours redownloaded, installing and configuring my software.</p>

<p>Viruses suck.  Virus makers should die.  Windows sucks for being so vulnerable or popular.  You pick.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/iBook-RIP">iBook - RIP</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>My iBook first died a few months ago.  The screen stopped working and I figured it was DOA.  I finally decided to take it into a repair shop today.  They can fix it but it will cost $500USD.  Thus it is going to remain dead.  I could buy a new Gateway laptop with much better specs for $150 more.  As much as I love my macs this poor doc can’t afford that kind of expense.</p>

<p>Excuse me.  I need a moment to mourn.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This mountain village near the Sea of Japan, withered to eight aging residents, concluded recently that it could no longer go on.</p>

  <p>So, after months of anguish, the villagers settled on a drastic solution: selling all of Ogama to an industrial waste company from Tokyo, which will turn it into a landfill.</p>

  <p>With the proceeds, the villagers, mainly in their 70’s, plan to pack up everything, including their family graves, and move in the next few years to yet uncertain destinations, likely becoming the first community in Japan to voluntarily cease to exist.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/pain-in-the-mouth">Pain in the mouth</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>A couple weeks ago I developed an abscess in the root of one of my top molars.  I had the whole swelling, tenderness and pain thing.  I felt like dying or ripping the thing out by the roots, either of which would have treated the problem.  Instead I wasted $50 seeing an “emergency dentist” who told me it was infected and needed to be drilled or removed.  Well, no shit sherlock.  I’m a fucking doctor–I know that.  Then he gave me heavy duty narcotic pain meds and an antibiotic, which isn’t exactly recommended by the dental societies.  </p>

<p>The key point is that it is very unlikely for the infection to go away without physically removing it via root canal or tooth removal and I have no money for either.  So, I’m trying to hold the bacteria at bay with antibiotics and asprin until my insurance at the new job kicks in.  </p>

<p>Things had actually gotten better for awhile.  The swelling, pain, sensitivity and looseness subsided.  </p>

<p>And came back yesterday.  I think I’ll end up losing the tooth if I wait on this, but I have no money.  So while I see patients who never pay, I myself can’t get the medical care I need for lack of money.  Isn’t it ironic, don’t you think?</p>

<p>At least if I ever get accused of not understanding what it is like to be poor or to go without medical case, I can laugh like the devil by the pale moon light.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>I have a new phone, the Samsung A900, or Blade.  </p>

<p>Actually, the phone is great.  I’ve had her about 5 months.  At first she was buggy with sluggish menus and needing to be reset everytime I wanted to use picturemail, but a few firmware updates later and she purrs.  Using Opera’s browser (the built-in one sucks), I can browse my favorite sites and check (and reply) to my gmail.  The megapixel camera is good for taking printable portraits and still-lifes, but being camphone, don’t hope for anything in motion or wining any contests.  She can connect to your computer using USB or bluetooth and you can put (and use) almost any files on her that way, including mp3 and pdf.  This also means you can create your own ringtones without paying the companies their extortion fees.  She comes with bluetooth that is fully functional, except for A2DP.  You can even program her to type text messages as you talk to her: voice-to-text.  I use her for flickr, blogging and surfing the internet, especially during long, boring medical lectures.</p>

  <li>Dimensions: 3.9” x 2.6” x 0.6”</li>
