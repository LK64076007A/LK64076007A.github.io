        <div class="content"><p>I am not a big fan of class action lawsuits in general because it appears that the only ones who really benefit at the lawyers. Maybe I’m wrong because I’m pretty happy about this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of the United States today filed a federal court complaint against AT&amp;T, accusing the carrier of misleading its smartphone customers by charging them for unlimited data while reducing their data speeds by up to 90 percent. - <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/28/ftc-sues-att-unlimited-data-throttling/">MacRumors</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had one of those “unlimited” plans and AT&amp;T sent rude text messages threatening to throttle me and then eventually did. I was using just over 2 gigabytes a month. I switched to Sprint. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The FTC alleges that AT&amp;T throttled customers who had used as little as 2GB of data beginning in 2011, and that the throttling is severe, “resulting in speed reductions of 80 to 90 percent for affected users.” AT&amp;T is said to have throttled 3.5 million customers more than 25 million times, violating the FTC Act in the process.  - <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/28/ftc-sues-att-unlimited-data-throttling/">MacRumors</a></p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>I like using static text documents to generate my blog. As many others have already said, it gives me control over my product and is easy to maintain and change. For the last several years, I’ve enjoyed using <a href="http://scriptogr.am">Scriptogram</a>, which both generated the HTML files from the text files stored in Dropbox, and also hosted the generated files. It was even free. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it does not seem to be in active development anymore. I probably could have left it alone and waited until the service died, but I got an itching in my brain after listening to the <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2014/10/episode-160-the-guarantee-of-free-speech/">last episode of Core Intuition</a> and decide to take a second crack<sup id="fnref:141028124001"><a href="#fn:141028124001" class="footnote">1</a></sup> at doing my own file generation and hosting<sup id="fnref:141028124050"><a href="#fn:141028124050" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>

<p>I’m currently getting my blog ported over to a Github hosted Jekyll site. Of course, I didn’t do the smart thing and wait until everything was finished before switching over the DNS, because <em>stupid</em> and I didn’t actually think anyone read this site<sup id="fnref:141028124228"><a href="#fn:141028124228" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Unfortunately, at least one person does and I wasted their time today when they tried to report a broken link in their feed reader. </p>

<p>My apologies. Hopefully the DNS and RSS is finished. No I just need to import my old articles and futz with the CSS. The latter shouldn’t cause any problems, and I hope the former doesn’t flood anyone’s RSS reader with old posts. </p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>I do a podcast with a couple other guys. As we’re recording the show, I like to create the show notes live so that they’re most accurate and save myself time later. We frequently mention products on Amazon, apps on iTunes, and regular old-fashioned links. I created the following macro for myself so that after I’ve navigated to the webpage of the link in Safari, I can automatically create a Markdown-style link in my text editor, including optional Amazon and iTunes affiliate links if appropriate. The affiliate links are added using python scrips from <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2013/08/new-apple-affiliate-link-scripts/">Dr. Drang</a> and <a href="http://nerdgap.com/amazon-affiliate-links-with-textexpander/">Brett Kelly</a>.</p>

<p>The macro can be triggered by the string <code>mdlink</code> of the hotkey ⇧⌃⌥⌘p.</p>

<p>Since I write all my show notes in nvALT and my workflow is to find the webpage in Safari, the first part of the macro activates nvALT. The topmost Safari URL is then saved to the clipboard. The clipboard is then parsed by two If statements looking to see if it is an Amazon or iTunes link, and if it is add the affiliate code. Finally, the text for the Markdown link in inserted using the Safari title as the text for the link.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>I create a lot of macros with KM and I like to share them both on this blog as well as in the KM forums<sup id="fnref:140729172855"><a href="#fn:140729172855" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Taking screenshots of the macro is an important part of this sharing and has been very useful to me as I have learned to use KM from my betters in the community. Previously, I would use the standard screen shot functions of OS X, but with very long macros that did not all fit on one screen there was no elegant solution.</p>

<p>I believe it was in <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/documentation/6/keyboardmaestro.html">6.0</a> that Peter added the ability to copy a macro as an image. I failed to pay much attention to this at the time in light of all the other great functionality, but recently put it to use.</p>

<p>The copy as an image puts the highlighted portion of your macro into the clipboard. By itself, this isn’t very useful because I need an actual image to upload to the blog, and as far as I can tell that functionality is not built in<sup id="fnref:140729173600"><a href="#fn:140729173600" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. </p>

<p>So I created a macro.</p>

<h2 id="macro-description">Macro description</h2>

<p>You can either select individual parts of the macro you want to share, or select nothing and the whole macro will be used.</p>

<p>Using a hotkey, trigger the <em>Create Screenshot Macro</em>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the <code>copy as image</code> from the menu</li>
  <li>Prompt the user for the file name</li>
  <li>Save the file to the desktop</li>
</ol>

  <p>While drug reps are certainly in sales, I have only personally seen a drug rep step over the line on one occasion. A new rep, who was clearly green, actually said to me and my colleague, “what would it take to get you to prescribe more of this drug?” I don’t think he was suggesting anything like bribery, but the statement was clearly inappropriate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been asked that question before. Based on context, I didn’t assume I was being bribed. I took it as “what medical and financial factors are keeping you from using my medication over another?”</p>

<p>My answers have been along the lines of “make it cheaper and/or show evidence of superiority in head-to-head trials”.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the £100 that was offered to the physicians in the referenced article is a lot less than the financial incentive when a patient demands oxycodone while holding a patient satisfaction survey. </p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>I just started using a second monitor at work<sup id="fnref:140207162201"><a href="#fn:140207162201" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. The problem was that every time I would plug my Macbook Air into the monitor via the Thunderbolt connection, the previously arranged window position was lost. I have a very simple arrangement: my text editor maximized on my laptop, and the EMR maximized on the external screen. </p>

<p><strong>Keyboard Maestro to the rescue.</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/Keyboard_Maestro_Dual_Screens.png"><img src="/images/Keyboard_Maestro_Dual_Screens.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>The main actions just move the desired application window to the top left of the respective screens, <code>SCREEN(1,</code> for the laptop screen and <code>SCREEN(2,</code> for the external monitor. The <code>+22</code> for the downward direction moves the window down below the menu bar, which is 22 pixels tall. The <code>-22</code> for the window height subtracts the menu height from the total window height so you don’t lose the last 22 pixels below the screen. </p>

<p>The hardest part of this macro is figuring out that you can type these commands into the action. Normally the action looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/Move_and_resize_1.png"><img src="/images/Move_and_resize_1.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>It looks like you can only input numbers<sup id="fnref:140207163434"><a href="#fn:140207163434" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, but if you start typing, it will transform to this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/Move_and_resize_2.png"><img src="/images/Move_and_resize_2.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> From the Yahoo Keyboard Maestro user group, I found more information on picking which screen you’re giving instructions to. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Numbers: designates the screens from left to right. 1, 2, 3…</li>
  <li>Main and Secondary: main refers to whatever screen is currently being used by the active window/application</li>
  <li>Internal and External: the iMac/laptop display versus the external display</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use these various designations depending on your use case. For example, I was originally using numbers, but that meant I had to have two separate macros for making a window maximized, one for the main monitor and one for the external, but by changing the <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> to <code>main</code>, it will maximize the window that has the focus on that screen. They have slightly different meanings, but this allows different functionality. </p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:140207162201">

<p>I love my Time Capsule and see myself continuing to buy them.</p>

<p>The Time Capsule I have is a 1st generation that I bought when they first came out. Living in an area without an Apple store at the time<sup id="fnref:130824090739"><a href="#fn:130824090739" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, I ended up driving 3 hours to get one.

<p>Several weeks/months ago my internal SSD suddenly died completely. I hadn’t made a clone back up or manually offloaded the data since the morning. I’d been working all day and had many, irretrievable projects that were lost, except for the Time Capsule back up from 30 minutes before.</p>

<p>I sent in the SSD on warranty, and when I got it back a week later, I booted up the new drive with it connected to the Time Capsule. It asked if I wanted to restore from the Time Capsule. I said yes and went to bed. </p>

<p>When I woke up in the morning, my baby was back.<sup id="fnref:130824091835"><a href="#fn:130824091835" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The beauty of the Time Capsule is it’s <em>fire and forget</em> usability.</p>

<p>That earns some loyalty.<sup id="fnref:wifebackup"><a href="#fn:wifebackup" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

        <div class="content"><p>I’ve had Editorial for less than an hour and I’ve made my first workflow. </p>

<p>I create my hacks as I need them and shortly after I starting writing I needed to change an unordered list to an ordered list. </p>

<p>First, I picked the action that outputs the selected text from the document. I then did a regex search for <code>^(\s*)[-*] </code><sup id="fnref:130818233455"><a href="#fn:130818233455" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to find the beginning of each line starting with the preface for an unordered list and replace it with <code>$11. </code>. The input is then used to replace the selected text in the document.</p>

<p>This was a good start but I wanted to be able to easily switch back and forth. I put those three actions inside an <code>if</code> action so that it only fires if it finds that there is a line starting with <code>-</code>. I added a <code>stop</code> action inside the <code>if</code> action to end the workflow once the if statement runs. I then added another <code>if</code> action that is basically the same except looks for lines starting with <code>1. </code> and replaces them with <code>- </code>. </p>

<p>Finally, I added an action at the beginning of the workflow that extends the selected text to the beginning and end of the lines to make selecting text a bit easier. </p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p><strong>Update: This post is long out of date. Zettt and I worked together to come up with a better, faster way to do the same thing with Keyboard Maestro. Find his latest version of his Keyboard Maestro Markdown Library to see it in action.</strong></p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>If you write in (Multi)Markdown and have Keyboard Maestro, I recommend you check out Andreas’s (@<a href="https://twitter.com/Zettt">Zettt</a>) <a href="http://www.macosxscreencasts.com/general/keyboard-maestro-markdown-library/">Keyboard Maestro Markdown library</a>, which makes it easy to write in Markdown through various schemes such as easily wrapping selected text with various special characters<sup id="fnref:20130530190615"><a href="#fn:20130530190615" class="footnote">1</a></sup>; creating inline links, reference links, and image tags with fill-in templates; making ordered and unordered lists from selected lines of text; and several others. His videos clearly explain how to use them. He also chose a brilliant hotkey schema that makes it easy to remember all the options once you learn one or two.</p>

<p>He’s currently working on some updates with the release of KM6, but that got me thinking about a modification I wanted to make.</p>

<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>

<p>As it stands now, after placing the footnote, the cursor is left at the bottom of the document, rather than back in the text where the writing will continue.<sup id="fnref:20130530193065"><a href="#fn:20130530193065" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This slight break in workflow is an unfortunate drawback of creating footnotes<sup id="fnref:20130530191980"><a href="#fn:20130530191980" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Some text editors do have the ability to remember cursor position so that it can be returned it to the original position, but one of the reasons I use Keyboard Maestro for these tasks is so they will be editor agnostic since I’m constantly changing my editor.</p>

<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>

<p>Keyboard Maestro 6 added a cursor position token: <code>%|%</code>. Since the original macro involved two paste actions separated by moving the cursor, I was going to need to combine them into one paste action. Instead of using ⌘-↓ to move the cursor to the bottom of the text, I use ⇧-⌘-↓ to select all the text from the cursor position to the bottom of the document. I then cut (⌘-X) this to the clipboard. Finally, I paste a concatenation of the footnote tag, the cursor position token, the clipboard, and the footnote:</p>

<pre>[^%Variable%MMDFootnoteTag%]%|%%CurrentClipboard%

[^%Variable%MMDFootnoteTag%]: %Variable%MMDFootnoteText%</pre>

<p>The extra carriage return is because, in my experience, you need to have a blank line between footnotes, unlike reference links, to get them to display correctly. Fletcher Penney <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide">recommends this format</a> with regards to bibliography support in Multimarkdown.</p>

<p>The final macro looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/modified_KM_macro_footnote.jpg"><img src="/images/modified_KM_macro_footnote.jpg" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>If you’re paying close attention, you might notice that I also added a default value for the footnote tag, which is just the date and time in <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/datetime">ICU yyyyMMddHHSS format</a>.</p>

<p>I think this makes it much easier and natural to write Multimarkdown footnotes, which may turn out to be a bad thing since I’m suddenly adding them all over the place.<sup id="fnref:20130530201400"><a href="#fn:20130530201400" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

  <li>
    <p>The hosts seem old, slow, and disheveled. I’m left wondering how these can be on the forefront of evaluating bleeding edge technology in an age of speed, simplicity, and beauty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their attempts at humor fall flat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Just as in the senate testimony, Cook refocuses the questions clearly but politely stating that he disagrees with the assumptions underlying the question.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hosts grill Cook on the stock price. When he points out that this is not a new phenomena and gives a history lesson on the stock, he asks “Do you know what the price was then?” the host replies “We don’t own Apple stock”.</p>

    <p>How does owning Apple stock have anything to do with knowing the price? Are you not a journalist? We’re you not the one who brought up the stock price in the first place? Now we’re supposed to believe you don’t follow it at all? Unbelievable, literally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook: Apple’s focus is on making the best product.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hosts: undeservedly arrogant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook on Google Glass: Thinks it won’t have broad appeal but will be useful in certain vertical markets. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook is wearing Nike Fuelband on stage. Likes it. Seems to imply that items that do one job do well work well so far, but multipurpose ones don’t and this needs to be solved. “Ripe for exploration.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Winning has never been about making the most. That has never been the cornerstone of Apple.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hosts: not pleasant people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook doesn’t use articles in front of Apple’s products. E.g. “I use iPad”, rather than “I use the/an iPad.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook: We will be rolling out the future of iOS and OS X in two weeks at our developer conference. “Jony has been really key.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook on taxes: Our return is 2 feet high. It’s too complicated. The tax code needs to be gutted and simplified, which is how Apple approaches everything. Our suggestions on how to do this might mean Apple plays more taxes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Tim comes across as polished, measured, thoughtful, and confident. I hadn’t seen him before except in the senate testimony and a few keynotes. Am impressed.</p>

<p>Hosts come across as slow, stubborn, and rude. Good hosts make a great show and interview. These hosts seemed to just get in the way and their little self-referential comments were annoying.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> On <a href="http://instaca.st/b/8f5">Amplified</a>, Myke Hurley called the hosts cringeworthy and said it’s a recurrent problem. </p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> and use it both daily for my workflow as well as occasionally for projects as they arise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Version 6.0</a> was released today and is a major upgrade over version 5. There are many improvements both major, minor, and cosmetic. It was well worth the $25 upgrade price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/">Macdrifter</a> has a nice write up and I’m sure that <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/keyboard-maestro-6-0-adds-syncing-browser-actions-device-triggers-and-more/">Macstories</a> will have a very detailed review within a few weeks.</p>

<p>Today I’m just going to share two small items made possible with the new version.</p>

<h2 id="shorter-macros-with-browser-text-tokens">Shorter macros with browser text tokens</h2>

<p>First, some types of macros are more easy to create and are smaller due to the <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/documentation/6/tokens.html">new web browser text tokens</a>. I had <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/Switching-the-current-viewed-webpage-between-Safari-and-Chrome">previously created a macro</a> that would take an URL that was currently open in Safari and open it in Chrome instead, and vice versa. </p>

<p>The macro in version 5 is fairly long:</p>

<p><a href="/images/switching_browsers_KM5.jpg"><img src="/images/switching_browsers_KM5.jpg" alt="Switching browsers in KM5 macro" /></a></p>

<p>The same macro in version 6 is much smaller:</p>

<p><a href="/images/switching_browsers_KM6.jpg"><img src="/images/switching_browsers_KM6.jpg" alt="Switching browsers in KM6 macro" /></a></p>

<p>This is all directly or indirectly because there is a text token for the current URL in both web browsers. This gets rid of the AppleScript for getting the URL. It also indirectly allows me to get rid of commands to open the opposite web browser as well as to wait for that browser to be open. In the version 5 macro, I had a command to switch to the new browser since that was necessary in order to enter the URL into the address bar. Since in my situation, I may not want to immediately switch over to the other browser, I was able to leave that off too.</p>

<h2 id="easy-creation-of-markdown-links-from-current-webpage">Easy creation of Markdown links from current webpage</h2>

<p>Seeing how easy it was to change the above macro, I decided to make a quick macro to make a Markdown link using the current Safari URL as the link URL and the current Safari window title as the link text. I also used the new text token <code>%|%</code> to place the cursor in position to quickly change the link text in case the window title isn’t appropriate.</p>

<p><a href="/images/MD_link_from_Safari_title_url.jpg"><img src="/images/MD_link_from_Safari_title_url.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I’m looking forward to upgrading my old macros and kicking the tires a bit more. I can’t wait for my next project so I have a chance to create something new.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>The title is a bit misleading, but I figured that’s what people would be searching for if they had the problem I’m intending to solve.</p>

<p>Technically, this article is about installing virtual Windows machines for free on your Mac so you can use PACS rather than about how to use PACS on a Mac, because, as far as I know, you can’t.</p>

<p>A colleague uses a Macbook Air at work except the hospitals imaging system uses PACS with some unfortunate software requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Internet Explorer 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0</li>
  <li>Windows XP (Service Pack 3) or Windows Vista Home Premium or Windows Vista Business 64 bit or Windows 7 32 and 64 bit </li>
  <li>Windows 3.1 Installer</li>
  <li>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 (Service Pack 1)</li>
  <li>Windows Media Player 11.0</li>
</ol>

<p>This made him sad because he also had to carry around a crappy Windows machine.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we were able to easily solve his problem today.<sup id="fnref:20130518185423"><a href="#fn:20130518185423" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The technique we used came from a <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/">2 year old article</a> from <a href="http://osxdaily.com">OSXDaily</a>. It uses VirtualBox from Oracle to create a virtual machine and then load a free version of Windows XP for the purposes of testing IE.</p>

<p>The technique is really pretty simple, although you need to not fear the terminal.</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">download and install Virtual Box</a>.</p>

<p>Second, go to the terminal<sup id="fnref:20130518191266"><a href="#fn:20130518191266" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and paste one of the following depending on the version of Internet Explorer you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 7</li>
</ul>

<p><code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="7" bash</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 8</li>
</ul>

<p><code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="8" bash</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 9</li>
</ul>

<p><code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="9" bash</code></p>

<p>In everything goes well, this will install the Windows operating system needed and the version of IE as well.</p>

<p>Finally, run the application VirtualBox and you’ll be able to boot up the Windows virtual machine.</p>

<p>If you have trouble doing that there are several more resources that can help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools">Microsoft’s virtualization website</a>. You can pick from Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://chriswharton.me/2013/02/installing-modern-ie-virtualization-on-virtualbox-for-mac/">Chris Warton’s blog</a>. Has some tips on installing one of the above Windowns virtual machines into Virtual Box. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">Greg Thornton’s Github repository</a> for automatic installation of Window’s VMs. Has more detailed instructions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know if this works for your and allows you to use PACS on your Mac. I’d be interested to know how much this is effecting physicians. </p>

<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:20130518185423">
      <p>Actually, it took forever to figure it out. While this technique worked perfectly on my Macbook Air 13 inch, for some reason it would immediately fail on his machine. For some reason, the installer couldn’t make the hidden directory <code>.revms</code> in his User folder. Once we figured that out, un-hide the hidden files, and created it manually, it worked fine. Took forever to figure that part out though. <a href="#fnref:20130518185423" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

        <div class="content"><p>I created a Keyboard Maestro macro to quickly create a link-blog post to Scriptogram without even needing to open a text editor.</p>

<p>The workflow is straight forward and assumes that you are <em>reading a website in Safari and have already copied the quote you want to the clipboard</em>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are prompted for an attribution (either the author or the website you’re quoting), the title of your post which will also be used as the url of your post and part of the file name, tags (optional), and comments (optional).</li>
  <li>The url of the frontmost tab in Safari is saved as a variable.</li>
  <li>Text is written to a file.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="/images/Quick_link-blog_macro_image.png"><img src="/images/Quick_link-blog_macro_image.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Only three steps. The real power is in what text is written to a file and the name of the file.</p>

<p>The text is just the boilerplate of a Scriptogram blog post with variables to fill in the data.</p>

<pre><code>Title: %Variable%Post Title%

Link: %Variable%currentURL%
Tags: %Variable%Tags%

[%Variable%Attribution%](%Variable%currentURL%):

&gt; %CurrentClipboard%

%Variable%Comments%
</code></pre>

<p>The text is written to a new file each time as long as the date and post title are unique. I like my file name to consist of the date and the post title as follows:</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>We doctors spend most of our working life documenting our clinical encounters but too often suffer from poor chart systems leading to inaccurate or inaccessible notes. We also fail to maintain ownership over our work product leading to a loss of useful clinical and practice information and worse patient care.</p>

<p>As an open, universally used EMR data standard does not exist, created my own system that I’d like to share with you. It is based on a set of principles that I’ve adopted from other modern, technological principles.</p>

<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Data must be easily entered at the point of care.</li>
  <li>Data must remain in the possession of the physician.</li>
  <li>Data must be protected from becoming unreadable due to expired proprietary formatting.</li>
  <li>Data must be encrypted.</li>
  <li>Data must be rapidly accessible both locally and remotely.</li>
  <li>Data must be easily searchable from outside the files proper.</li>
  <li>Data must be easily displayed in a aesthetically pleasing format that can be changed in time.<sup id="fnref:1366329887-fn1"><a href="#fn:1366329887-fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>

<p>Buy an 11 inch Macbook Air and turn on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault">File Vault</a> (full disk encryption) in the system preferences. </p>

<h1 id="solution---software">Solution - Software</h1>

<p>Write your notes into a plain text editor, using a text macro application, and save them as plain text files into one folder.</p>

<h1 id="the-painful-part---putting-your-note-in-their-chart">The Painful Part - Putting <em>Your</em> note in <em>Their</em> chart</h1>

<p>Your note saved in your records needs to be placed in the clinic or hospital records that the patient is at. If they have an EMR, just copy and paste the note into their application. If it is a paper chart, print it out.</p>

<h1 id="security">Security</h1>

<p>Maintain physical security over your laptop. It must always be in your possession or locked up in a safe or office that no one else (including janitors) have access to. The easiest system it to just keep your computer on you always, or locked in a safe at home.</p>

<p>Make a strong password. At least 8 characters, capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and symptoms. Make it some kind of phrase that it easy to remember and type. E.g. <code>Caesar?:ettu,Brute</code><sup id="fnref:1366329887-fn2"><a href="#fn:1366329887-fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="backups">Backups</h1>

<p>Make <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/clone-backups-why-and-how">clone back ups</a> of your machine. Make multiple copies of your back ups. Encrypt them. Keep them locked up. You can even make a USB necklace with all the notes on them.<sup id="fnref:1366329887-fn3"><a href="#fn:1366329887-fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="search">Search</h1>

<p>Use <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2531">Spotlight</a> or the powerful search feature of <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> to rapidly search through all your notes when you need to find something like “all your patients with psoriatic arthritis on azathioprine” or “all the consults sent to me by Dr. so-and-so”.</p>

<h1 id="formatting">Formatting</h1>

<p>Formatting is really not necessary but if you want to print out pretty notes or add letterhead to your faxed PDFs, you can use the <a href="http://bywordapp.com/markdown/guide.html">Markdown format</a> when writing your notes and the <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked application</a> for creating pretty PDFs with custom CSS formatting.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In the end, you have an accurate, fast, reliable, secure, and searchable record system. It’s relatively cheap with the only significant cost being the hardware. You can use it across multiple clinics and hospitals using different medical record systems while maintaining a single unified records system on all your patients. </p>

<h1 id="future">Future</h1>

<p>I hope we don’t have to wait long until we do have cross platform, open EMR records. Until then, I think this is the best solution for physicians who have a modicum of nerd power.</p>

        <div class="content"><p>Physicians spend a large part of their day documenting what they do, primarily in the form of the clinic note, but also telephone notes, record reviews, and the legions of forms the government and insurance companies create.</p>

<p>Over my time as a fellow and a private practice physician, I’ve created what I consider a relatively elegant and easy system for moderately skilled tech-nerd physicians to create, store, retrieve and disseminate their documentation and I’d like to share a small part of it with you.</p>

<p>I didn’t mean this post to become as long as it had. I tried to keep it short by leaving out most of the specifics, potential pitfalls, and alternatives. I failed. So I’ve created a “too long: didn’t/don’t read” (TL;DR) version that is both interspersed throughout the text below or <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/a-doctors-notes-abbreviated">available as a separate post</a>.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Data is important. </p>

<p>Data fails when it is inaccurate or inaccessible.</p>

<p>Paper charts and modern EMRs excel at failing in both of these areas. </p>

<p>Physicians need a better way to manage their clinical notes than is afforded by the software tools they are issued and most clinics and hospitals. </p>

<h1 id="inaccurate">Inaccurate</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL: DR: Boilerplate templates and copy-and-paste (CAP) have resulted in voluminous, inaccurate notes. Poorly designed software that inhibits data entry encourages the use of these templates and copy-and-pasted inaccuracies. This also inhibits entering all the pertinent data so that data is lost due to lack of documentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The perils of modern EMR documentation are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/04/us-electronic-medical-records-idUSBRE9030IJ20130104">well described in the literature</a>. Most of the inaccuracies are created because of a combination of pressure to document unnecessary data in conjunction with the power to easily create this unnecessary documentation by templates or copy-and-paste. </p>

<p>Daily, I see patients in consultation for very specific joint symptoms in which the prior notes have a well documented, template-created, ENT exam but no joint exam.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn1"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I saw one patient whose initial visit to his PCP was for a sore throat and the exam dutifully noted pharyngeal erythema and tonsilar exudate, as did every subsequent exam for the next 2 years. Either it was the longest lasting case of strep throat in the history of medicine or the data was inaccurate. </p>

<p>All physicians know that a detailed, page long list of negative symptoms is most likely to mean the ROS was never done rather than that it was done completely. </p>

<p>And yet, sadly, this data stands as canon in the indelible, idealized EMR.</p>

<p>When you can’t even look at your own notes from a year ago and trust in their accuracy, you’re lost. </p>

<p>Another part of the reason that the data is inaccurate is because of numerous barriers to data entry. In a finite amount of time, I will have to document less if I use a feather quill than if I use a ballpoint pen. The same is true with computers. If the software is poorly designed requiring multiple screens, menus, pop ups, check boxes, and radial dialogue boxes, then the data will be incomplete or less accurate because it could not be entered frictionlessly.</p>

<p>It seems clear to me that no one who has ever created the UI of an EMR has actually had to use it to document multiple encounters in a busy clinical practice. This may explain why those physicians who frequently praise their EMR are either academics whose residents are writing their notes, or have paid underlings entering most of the data.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn2"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="inaccessibility">Inaccessibility</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL:DR: Modern EMRs, paper charts, changing jobs, network outages, server crashes, and outdated/unsupported data formats all conspire to keep you from accessing the data you created and need to take care of your patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Physicians spend a large amount of their time documenting the clinical history and exam; the interpretation of the combined history, exam, labs, imaging, and pathology; and treatments (and most importantly) the response to treatments over time. This historical knowledge is priceless and yet too often is neglected.</p>

<p>As physicians spend so much time creating this record and since it is so important to providing the best possible care, you would think we would guard this record religiously and yet I would assume that most physicians have no ownership over their work product. It is a common theme in the internet nerd community that one should own their data so that if you decide to stop using a company or the company shuts down, you have not lost your data. How much more important are our clinic notes than some Instagram photos or blog posts about your latests cooking experiment? </p>

<p>Notes can be inaccessible to the physician who created them for many reasons but primarily due to no longer working at the facility where they created the not or just not having remote<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn3"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> access.</p>

<p>Notes are written in one practice but when the physician leaves he doesn’t take the notes with him. In the days of paper charts, this might have been an unfortunate necessity but in the digital age the entire record could fit on a thumb drive.</p>

<p>Notes are written in the hospital on rounds. The notes stay in the hospital chart, completely inaccessible to the individual physicians’s clinic EMR. </p>

<p>Not long ago a colleague left the state. I inherited many of his patients. I was completely unable to get records. He no longer had them as having left them with the clinic when he moved. The hospital owned clinic was shut down. The hospital medical records department had no idea where they might be and seemed insulted that I would even ask them the question as their mandate ended at the hospital doors. All that knowledge and work was lost.</p>

<p>Next, records can be inaccessible because they are locally stored but you are remote, or because they are remotely stored, “in the cloud” in today’s parlance, but the internet/server/power is down. Local data is fast, while remote data is slow. Remote data can be ubiquitous, while local data isn’t.</p>

<p>Finally, data can become inaccessible due to proprietary data formats. Again, it is well documented that many EMRs create lock-in with their proprietary data format. Even if you can someone get that data out, it is unlikely that the data will survive future advances in technology. Simply put, I cannot read documents I created with word processors from the early 1990s, where as I can still read hand written notes from the same time. Data needs to be in some kind of common, non-proprietary, future-proof format.</p>

<h1 id="solution-preamble">Solution preamble</h1>

<p>This is not a best practices solution.</p>

<p>This is not an ideal solution.</p>

<p>This is a practical, this-is-the-world-I’m-living-in solution. </p>

<p>It is based on principles that are unchanging but is created with tools that are constantly changing and therefore it adopts to the tools.</p>

<p>It is not a complete EMR. It is a note taking system that I use that is powerful, practical, and functional within the confines of the modern medical system. I certainly wish there was a feature complete, powerful, EMR that allowed me to own my data and accurately input my notes with the benefits of remote and local storage combined. There is not.</p>

<p>It is not likely to be useful as-is for most physicians, but those with a modicum of technical knowledge should be able to easily adapt it or it’s principles to their own system.</p>

<h1 id="solution---hardware">Solution - Hardware</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL:DR: Buy an 11 inch Macbook Air and turn on File Vault in the system preferences. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the software is probably the most important part of my system, everything starts with the hardware. Hospitals and large medical clinics typically buy cheap Dell computers running Windows. This inevitably leads to slow, uncustomizable, one-size-fits-no-one machines running outdated software, bogged down by bloatware and viruses.</p>

<p>My weapon of choice is a Macbook Air. Apple computers are considered more expensive, but comparing equivalent models, are equal or cheaper than a similarly powered machine from another company. SSD drives are ridiculously faster than the traditional HDD. The Macbook Air<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn6"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn6" class="footnote">5</a></sup> is light enough to be easily carried around a clinic or hospital and small enough to type with on your lap or throw on any counter, exam table, or chair. The size also means that I can easily take it with me anywhere resulting in physical security of my files, part of the HIPAA requirement. While $1000 may be expensive compared to cheap Windows laptops, it’s cheaper than any board test I ever took and for something I use 8-12 hours a day, seems like a bargain to me.</p>

<p>The operating system for a new Macbook Air is OS X 10.8 or “Mountain Lion”. This operating system has built-in full disk encryption. While benchmark tests will show that this slows down the speed of the machine (as the CPU has to decrypt and re-encrypt your data on the fly as you open and change files) in clinical practice you will never notice. Having all my files encrypted provides security to my patient’s data and has frequently shut down any complaints from CMIOs that I’m using my personal hardware in the clinic. This disk encryption is part of keeping your patient records safe and HIPAA compliant and most clinics and hospitals have yet to comply with this kind of security. When my last clinic decided to implement disk encryption on numerous Windows machines from Dell and HP running various OS’s and with standard HDDs it was a nightmare. Nurses were locked out of computers for days and a drastic decrease in speed was noted immediately. In OS X you just need to flip a switch.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn7"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn7" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>If you want, you can get an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse to use when not mobile. My colleague does this. My wife and I do not.</p>

<h1 id="solution---software">Solution - Software</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL:DR: Write your notes into a plain text editor, using a text macro application, and save them as plain text files into one folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I have the hardware, the next question is what to use to create the note. </p>

<p>Short answer: Anything but the EMR.</p>

<p>Longer answer: EMRs seem almost deliberately designed to be impossible to create notes with easily. They also typically store the data in proprietary formats and the data is usually locked into the EMR. So don’t use it. Yes, in a sense this creates more work, but I argue you’ll save time in other ways and with the benefit of owning your data.</p>

<p>I advocate you write your notes in plain text. Plain text is praised by programmers and nerds of every walk of life from <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1161549/forget_fancy_formatting_why_plain_text_is_best.html">lawyers</a> to physicians because it is “open”, non-proprietary, future-proof, easily encryptable, easily compressible, and results in small file sizes.</p>

<p>Plain text can be written in any text editor. You can even write in word processors like Word or Pages, but I strongly recommend against it. All computers come with a text editor like TextEdit on the Mac and there are many different free and cheap text editors available. Byword, IA Writer, Multimarkdown Composer<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn8"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn8" class="footnote">7</a></sup>, TextWrangler, and Textmate are just a few that I own and use based on my whim and mood. The great thing about plain text is that it does not have any formatting that locks it into one application.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn9"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn9" class="footnote">8</a></sup> So if you create a months worth of notes in Byword and then decide to start using IA Writer because of its cute blue cursor, you don’t have to change anything about your data.</p>

<p>Your text editor will present you with one big text field that you can type or dictate into. No modal boxes. No pull down menus. No changing from screen to screen just to document different parts of the HPI.</p>

<p>I save each clinic, phone, and hospital note as a separate text document in one large folder called “patient notes”<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn10"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn10" class="footnote">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Of course, a large empty sheet can be intimidating and also somewhat slow. You don’t want to have to type out your headers and other boilerplate every time. For example, you don’t want to type out the name and date yourself each time you create a note, do you? So you need a text macro program. I’ve written about these before and there are plenty of others who have as well. Anything you are going to type over and over should be automated<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn11"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn11" class="footnote">10</a></sup>. </p>

<p>I use <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> and you can read my <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/tag/textexpander">many posts</a> on it or search the web for other’s articles. Basically, get a text macro program and learn how to use it. Don’t create all your macros at once. Build them up slowly and organically over time as you need them. It will take awhile, but your speed and accuracy in documentation will be impressive. In time, you will go from macros that turn <code>.hum</code> into <code>adalimumab (Humira)</code> to macros that turn <code>.mtx1</code> into <code>Rx: start methotrexate 2.5mg, take 15mg (6 pills) every 7 days, #30, refill 1</code> and eventually into macros that turn <code>.ddxcie</code> into</p>

<pre><code>Differential diagnosis of chronic inflammatory effusion/monoarthritis

1. Mycobacterial infection  
2. Fungal infection
3. Lyme arthritis  
4. Monoarticular presentation of rheumatoid arthritis  
5. Seronegative spondyloarthropathies  
6. Sarcoid arthritis   
7. Foreign-body synovitis  

Consider ordering: CCP, RF, TB (quantiferon), ACE level, fungal cultures and smear, mycobacterial cultures and smear, Lyme serum, Lyme PCR joint, MRI, HLA-B27, ophthalmology consult, and/or CXR if not already complete.

<p>Some EMRs<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn12"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn12" class="footnote">11</a></sup> have macro functionality built in but that is limited to the program and the confines/rules of the program. By using a separate application that functions on top of the underlying applications you can use the same macros anywhere. So, if I get an curbside consult email from a family physician asking about what they should be considering in a patient with a chronic inflammatory effusion of the right knee, I can actually type 7 characters and hit send.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn13"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn13" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<p>I have a friend who has created amazing macros for things like the NIH stroke scale and a complete neurological physical exam that not only allows him to quickly document those items, but also serves as a kind of checklist to remind him not to skip anything. </p>

<p>I use it for everything from commonly misspelled works, to entire paragraphs of patient education, to plans of care, to templated procedure notes, to macros that calculate and type the patient’s age when I type the patients date of birth into the note.</p>

<p>Other Examples: </p>

<ul>
  <li><code>.dxra</code> = Rheumatoid arthritis (714.0)  </li>
  <li><code>HepB/C</code> = hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody </li>
  <li><code>.posana</code> = A positive ANA does not diagnose an autoimmune disease nor does a negative result exclude it; however, ANA is positive in 99% of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus therefore a negative result strongly argues against such a diagnosis.  ANA can be positive by definition in 5% of the healthy population, typically in titers less than 1:320.  Up to 20% of healthy relatives of patients with rheumatic disease and up to 75% of healthy individuals older than 70 will have a positive ANA (typically less than 1:80 with a speckled or homogenous pattern).  Other conditions associated with a positive ANA are thyroid disease, chronic infections including TB/viral hepatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, malignancies, any of the auto-immune or connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis and patients with silicone breast implants.  In the absence of physical or biochemical evidence of pathology, a positive ANA is not clinically useful. </li>

<p>One type of macro I use constantly is one that changes any medicine abbreviations like LEF into the full generic <em>and</em> brand name: leflunomide (Arava). This creates an extra level of education and safety for other physicians who may not be as familiar with our specialities medicines and also for the patient, who may know their drug by it’s generic name “Avara” while I type LEF or leflunomide. I frequently give my patient’s their notes or at least the assessment and plan at the end of each visit so having this clarity built in without any extra work on my part is important.</p>

<h1 id="the-painful-part---putting-your-note-in-their-chart">The Painful Part - Putting <em>Your</em> note in <em>Their</em> chart</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL:DR: Your note saved in your records needs to be placed in the clinic or hospital records that the patient is at. If they have an EMR, just copy and paste the note into their application. If it is a paper chart, print it out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you have <em>your</em> note. Now what? This depends on the medical record system for your hospital or clinic, but with one commonality: it will be ugly, slow, inelegant, and painful. You have to put your note into the medical records of the clinic or hospital in which you’re seeing the patient. EMRs are not open and do not use common data formats even between the same EMR at different hospitals. Paper charts are still used widely in most hospitals in the country. There’s just no getting around this no matter what you do. If you want to keep your data and want to benefit from the legibility and speed of typed text on your own machine, you just have to put up with it.</p>

<p>At my last job the clinic had an EMR and the hospital used paper charts. It is likely that you have a similar situation. </p>

<h2 id="emr-charts">EMR Charts</h2>

<p>In my EMR and in whatever EMR you are likely to be using, you will need to copy and paste the text into the EMR. In EMR’s that have a large open text field like CPRS this is relatively easy. In complicated EMRs like NextGen, you’ll have to find a free text dialogue box and paste it in there before “generating” the note. There may be issues with poor line formatting but there are ways around this.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn14"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn14" class="footnote">13</a></sup> </p>

<p>Frankly, I have to force myself not to care about the formatting of my notes in the EMR because those who make them and those who buy them just don’t care and I would waste hours of my time trying to make them look good. I just copy-and-paste, close my eyes, and hit submit. I have to console myself that the note in my system and the note I send out to the physicians consulting me looks like I actually care.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn15"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn15" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="paper-charts">Paper Charts</h2>

<p>When at a clinic or hospital with a paper chart, I carry a small, retractable universal printer cord with me that I can plug it into the back of the networked printers at the nursing stations and just printing my note to place in the chart.</p>

<h1 id="solution---backup-and-security">Solution - Backup and Security</h1>

<p>These are your notes. These are your patient’s notes. They are gold and they are poison. You absolutely cannot afford to lose them to theft or to data lose both because of the loss of such valuable information and also due to potentially severe financial penalties from violating patient privacy laws. Your back ups and your security must be strong and usable (read: easy).</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>First, you must maintain physical security. This means the computer you use and any back ups you have must be physically protected. You don’t leave your computer unattended in your office. You don’t leave your back ups in your unlocked office on your desk. </p>

<p>My computer is on me 90% of the time during normal life, and when it is not, it is locked up. My backups are also either on my person or locked away in a hidden location. Use both physical security and security by obscurity. </p>

<p>Second, you must have a strong password to lock your machine. It should be easy to remember and easy to type but it also needs to be long <sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn16"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn16" class="footnote">15</a></sup> and not simple words. iloveyou, password, 1234567, qwerty, asdfjkl; and temporary are not secure passwords. Use 3-4 words you can easily remember but aren’t easily associated with you (kids and pets names are bad), substitute a few characters here and there, and that should be good enough in most cases. A good one might be something like <code>Caesar?:ettu,Brute</code><sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn17"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn17" class="footnote">16</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Third, your data should be encrypted. This can be really complicated and painful to do. But you bought a Macbook Air and turned on File Vault, right? Ok, moving on.</p>

<p>Finally, your remote data must also be transmitted and physically stored securely. If you’re using a public company then I would say to be safe you need to have a HIPAA (I think the fancy acronym for this is BAA.) agreement in place with them and they need to promise that they are following HIPAA compliant practices. Most services such as Dropbox, do not. ;-( </p>

<p>Thankfully, there is a new product (and more on the way) that provides remote, encrypted data in a Dropbox-style fashion for a reasonable price: <a href="http://filetransporter.com">Transporter</a>. You can plug their device into your own networks (that should be physically and electronically secured) and it creates a Dropbox-style folder on your machine giving you the power of Dropbox (both remote and local data synchronization) without the messy business agreements and monthly cost. <em>I have not implemented this into my workflow yet</em>, but will in the next two months. I plan on having one at my clinic and one at home providing cloud storage and back up while maintaining a local copy as well. </p>

<h2 id="backup">Backup</h2>

<p>There are many articles out there on the importance of backing up your data. Google them. Read them. Do them.</p>

<p>I make multiple <a href="/2013/03/15/The-safety-of-clone-backups.html">clone back ups</a> of my computer which includes my patient notes. I keep one copy on me and I keep two other copies locked in fire proof safes. It’s really not that hard and it is your responsibility. </p>

<p>You can also set up a remote backup/storage using something like the <a href="http://filetransporter.com">Transporter</a> mentioned above.</p>

<p>Finally, text files are so small, you can even easily keep a copy of them on an encrypted USB drive you wear around your neck on a chain.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn18"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn18" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Now that’s dedication.</p>

<p>Backup up my data is just a part of my day. I’d sooner leave my door unlocked then not backing up my files.</p>

<p>So that covers principles 1-5 that I [enumerated above][Principles], leaving only search and formatting. </p>

<h1 id="solution---search">Solution - Search</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use Spotlight or the powerful search functions in applications like TextWrangler to search quickly and easily in all your notes at once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google redefined the power of search in our minds, first with ability to easily search the entire internet and then the ability to search your mail, your desktop, and all your files. Rather than having to store files/emails in complicated, sub-nested folders, you just type a few words that you expect to find in the file/email and instantly see all the matching results.</p>

<p>Mac’s<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn20"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn20" class="footnote">18</a></sup> have full, in-file text search built into the operating system. It’s called Spotlight and you can bring it up easily by hitting ⌘-spacebar or clicking on the magnifying class icon in the upper right of your screen. This is the fastest way to search your files. If you need a bit more power and fine-tuning use Spotlight the Finder (option-command-spacebar).</p>

<p>Just today a colleague asked me how many patients with psoriatic arthritis I have that are on azathioprine (Imuran). I didn’t think I had any, but I checked and by typing the following characters and nothing else, I brought up the 4 notes on one patient in which I did: <code>⌘-spacebar .psa .aza</code>.</p>

<p>Although I’m told that this is possible in some EMRs such as ***, it was not possible on the EMRs I’ve used in the past including NextGen, Epic, CPRS, and IPR.</p>

<p>Another example of this power is when another specialist approached me recently to ask about a patient he sent me. He couldn’t remember their name and actually thought I probably hadn’t seen the patient yet. By searching for consults ordered by this physician, I was able to pull up the consult note before he’d even finished speaking, and tell him my findings.</p>

<p>And I use this search functionally all the time. Whenever my nurse mentions a patient to me, my reflexes kick in and I quickly have their last clinic note open, and a new note created and ready for me to document whatever we’re about to talk about. </p>

<p>It is about uniquitous access to information and easy, rapid creating of new data. I’ve never read GTD, but I wouldn’t be afraid to show my system to David Allen.</p>

<h1 id="formatting">Formatting</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL:DR: Adding formatting takes some more work and nerdery that you may want. If so, just write in plain text—it’s fine. If you do want to be fancy then learn <a href="">Markdown</a> and <a href="">CSS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By it’s very nature and what makes it useful for this kind of system, plain text does not have any formatting but there there are times when you may want some formatting. This is why many people when they write papers will use something like Word so they can add strange fonts, weird colors, or pictures. I was tempted to the dark side at one point because I wanted to have my letterhead in the header of the document. This is easiest with a word processor program but can still be accomplished with some nerdery.</p>

<p>I write my notes in a style called Markdown. Markdown allows you to write in plain text but add some extra characters that allow the plain text to be converted to a formatted style like HTML, while still maintaining readability in the plain text.</p>

<p>Confused? Me too at first, so here’s an example.</p>

<p>If I want to <strong>bold</strong> something, I just put two asterisks on either side of the words  **like this**. When you read it in plain text it “looks” bold or emphasized, right? Markdown also includes formatting for <em>_italics_</em>, headers, numbered lists, bullet lists, and links.</p>

<p>I then use an application called <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a> which will take my text notes and display/save/print them with the Markdown formatting as well as with any other formatting I’ve created as a template using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>. When I’m going to print a copy of my note for the patient or the referring physician, or when I’m going to archive it as a PDF<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn21"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn21" class="footnote">19</a></sup> I run it through Marked to get the final document. </p>

<p>This allows me to take a note that looks like what is on the left and print a note that looks like what you see on the right.</p>

<p><a href="/images/noteandMarkedpreview.png"><img src="/images/noteandMarkedpreview.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>When I change clinics (new letterhead) or change moods (different font) or get older (bigger font), I can just change one CSS file rather than having to change every old note.</p>

<p><a href="/images/CSSnoteexamples.png"><img src="/images/CSSnoteexamples.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>This last step is a bit more complicated and requires more educational investment that most will want to do. It’s ok. You can still make great looking notes just using plain text formatting either with or without Markdown. Other possibilities are to use ALL CAPS for your headers, or to just print your notes out on a printer that is loaded with your office’s letterhead. </p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>What I have is an accurate, fast, reliable, secure, and searchable record system for every patient I’ve ever seen. The cost of the hardware is significant, but relatively not that expensive<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn22"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn22" class="footnote">20</a></sup> and something I would buy anyway even if I wasn’t a physician. The cost of the software can range from free to less than 100 USD. The skills necessary to use this system seem minimal to me, but being a tech nerd, I recognized that my opinion may be heavily biased. You will likely need to be able to type fast or have good dictation software. You will need to be comfortable around computers, which for our eminent members is likely not a given, but will certainly be standard for our new initiates. The more “advanced” features like Markdown and CSS, really aren’t that difficult compared to memorizing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle">Kreb cycle</a> or knowing when to appropriately order an <a href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-rheumatology/">ANA</a>.</p>

<h1 id="future">Future</h1>

<p>I didn’t create this system because I think I’m the smartest guy out there. I created it because I needed something that worked and everything I’ve used since I started my medical education<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn23"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn23" class="footnote">21</a></sup> has been truly atrocious to the point that even <a href="http://vimeo.com/31926572">John Gruber took notice</a>.</p>

<p>I truly hope that someday a system is created that works wonderfully and follows the principles I’ve listed above. At a minimum, I hope that a system is created that is so wonderful and powerful that I am willing to compromise on those principles in order to use it as it will mean a vast improvement in the care of patients and in the work burden of all physicians.</p>

This can be easily fixed by either changing the character for the line break when pasting using an application like Keyboard Maestro (this is what my neurology friend does), or some Text Editors like IA Writer let you choose your line break character when saving the file as in the image below.   <a href="#fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn14" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When I was in medical school, they issued the student’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLIÉ">Sony Cliés</a>[^1365609755-Model PEG-TJ27]. It was an awesome little device for the time and I took a lot of notes on it while on rounds. Sadly, a few years later, I was unable to read the files when the Clié finally died and I was unable to read the files with any of the software on my computers.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been an advocate for plain text file. Plain text does not use any strange or proprietary formatting so the files can be read on any platform and in any app. The data is about as future-proof as you can get.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1161549/forget_fancy_formatting_why_plain_text_is_best.html">many other benefits to plain text as well</a>.</p>

<p>Although I use many apps on many devices to read my plain text files, my favorite by far is <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2012/02/28/nvalt-2-2-public-beta/">nvALT</a>. It is fast, responsive, intuitive, and created by <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/about/">a programmer I highly respect</a>. Unfortunately, it is free, but you can donate money like I did to support its continued development. </p>

<p>Today I found another useful way to use nvALT.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-plain-text-wiki">Creating a plain text wiki</h2>

<p>As I was reading an article on auto-inflammatory syndromes, I was struck with the idea of creating a list of all the rheumatology diseases. I hit my hotkey trigger to bring up nvALT and typed “rheumatology diseases” to see if I might have started such a list before. No results appeared, so I hit enter and the document with the title “rheumatology diseases” was created.</p>

<p>I copy and pasted the list of auto-inflammatory diseases into the note and went back to reading the article. As is typical, the article started with the first disease and moved down the list. <em>Now I wanted another text document about that disease in which I could write some notes</em>. While it wouldn’t be hard to do, wouldn’t it be nice if the original list of diseases could link to this other document so I could easily browse them in the future?</p>

<p>It happens that nvALT has an in-app feature<sup id="fnref:1365609755-fn1"><a href="#fn:1365609755-fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> that allows you to create links to other documents by wrapping the words in [[double brackets]]. Whatever words are in double brackets link to a note with the same words as the title. Example: “I love to eat [[chocolate]].” would link to a document with the name chocolate.txt. In my case, “FMF - [[familial Mediterranean fever]]” linked to a new document “familial Mediterranean fever.txt”.</p>

<p>As I read my way through the journal article, I created a new text document for each disease that is linked to from the disease list document. I imagine in this way, I could accidentally end up writing a book someday, or maybe just a good wiki for my website. Since I’m writing it all in Markdown anyway, the conversion would be relatively simple.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Today they launched version 6 of their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen-6/id609301478?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen-6/id609301478?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro</a> application for the Mac. </p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpenpro-6/id609313570?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro is $40</a></p>

<p>PDFpen Pro is a powerful PDF editor. It has the simple editing functions typical of what you would expect even on an iOS app: highlighting, notes, commenting, shapes, stamps, signatures, deskewing, resampling, cropping, etc..</p>

<p>The real power comes from its other editing abilities.</p>

<h2 id="redacting-information">Redacting Information</h2>

<p>You can redact text either by deleting it and replacing it with a black bar, a la spy movies, or delete it completely and leave it blank. </p>

<p>Example: The ACR has an excellent handout on a certain disease but one line is outdated. Rather than re-creating the whole PDF, just remove the one outdated line. </p>

<p>Example: Need to send your tax return to some company, but don’t want your social security exposed? You can do a search and replace redaction through the entire document in just a few seconds.</p>

<h2 id="make-non-fillable-pdfs-fillable">Make Non-Fillable PDFs Fillable</h2>

<p>It seems to be a bad habit in medical administration to use a scanned copy of an old paper document for application forms rather than creating fresh, fillable PDFs. We both know that we will never change the archaic practices of established medical organizations like state medical boards, but that doesn’t mean we have to be slaves to them. </p>

<p>Rather than suffering this indignity, open the PDF with PDFpen Pro and choose <code>Edit &gt; Create Form Fields</code>. PDFpen Pro will go through and find all the places that should be fillable and create them. Now you can complete the PDF as easily as is possible and email it back. </p>

<p>Here’s an example I did with my own consult order form:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/MTMG%20consult%20order%20form.pdf">Here is the PDF that was made by exporting from Pages</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/MTMG%20consult%20order%20form%20fillable2.pdf">And here the same PDF after using the PDFpen Pro</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly the second option is more professional and easier for the user to complete.</p>

<p>If you happen to be one of those “established medical organizations” I mentioned, then you can make your own forms fillable now and save your customers time and yourself the hassle of trying to read doctor handwriting.</p>

<p><strong>I also used this in my clinic to turn the radiology departments order form into a fillable PDF that automatically inserted the correct days date, my signature, and a pick menu of the common reasons I order imagine studies with the associated ICD-9 codes.</strong></p>

<h2 id="create-pdf-forms">Create PDF Forms</h2>

<p>Especially if you are a professional (individual or organization), the forms you host on the internet should be clean, fresh PDFs that are fillable, rather than blurry, tilted, off-center scans of old word documents. PDFpen Pro has complete features to create fillable PDFs including check boxes, radio buttons, drop-down pick lists, and fillable text boxes. You can create new PDFs from scratch in PDFpen Pro, or import PDFs created in other applications like Word or Pages and add the fillable areas. </p>

<h2 id="turn-pdfs-into-word-documents">Turn PDFs Into Word Documents</h2>

<p>An interesting new feature of PDFpen Pro version 6 is the ability to take a PDF document and turn it into an editable Word document. I’m not sure if this is a feature I’d use myself since I can already edit PDFs with PDFpen Pro and I don’t use Word, but other professionals have told me that this is something they’re really excited about.</p>

<p>David Sparks, lawyer, has an <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2013/3/pdfpen-version-6">excellent blog post with an 8 minute video</a> including an example of this. </p>

<h2 id="watermarking">Watermarking</h2>

<p>Want to send out a PDF to others but either make sure that your intellectually property is marked, or that it’s clearly labeled as a <code>draft</code>? PDFpen Pro can easily watermark every page of a document so that your message is clear.</p>

<h2 id="ocr">OCR</h2>

<p>In addition, I also use PDFpen Pro to OCR documents for me. OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition and is the process by which computers take a flat image and find the words inside that image. For example, you are probably aware that when you type a document you can search inside that document for a specific word, but if you have a picture in that document and there happens to be a word in the picture it will not find the word. When you scan a document or take a picture of the document, the words themselves are not recognized. To make the words machine readable, you need to use OCR.</p>

<p>PDFpen Pro has a fast and accurate OCR. When I scan bills, contracts, patient records, and any other documents, I always make sure to OCR them so I can later search within the document. If I take a photo of a document with my iPhone, it uploads to a Dropbox folder and PDFpen Pro OCRs the document so it’s searchable later. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You have 100 pages of outside records on a patient. You want to know if they have previously been on azathioprine. If your document was scanned without being OCR’d, which has been the case in every clinic and hospital I’ve worked at, then you have to flip through every page manually looking for the word. On the other hand, if you OCR’d the document, then you can just search for <code>azathioprine</code>.</p>

<p>You can open a document in PDFpen Pro and have it OCR the document for you. Better yet, you can get really nerdy and use scripts written by others to watch for any new PDFs added to a specific folder (for example, your <code>patient records</code> folder) and automatically OCR them without bothering you.</p>

<p>I also use this technique whenever I’m on a webpage with image text that I want to save and manipulate. I take a screenshot that is automatically saved to the desktop, I add “OCR” to the file name, and PDFpen Pro sees that (via a Hazel task) and automatically OCRs it for me.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>PDFpen and PDFpen Pro can be bought either on the Mac App Store or directly from Smile. The MAS version includes iCloud syncing, which is not available with the direct purchase option.</p>

<p><strong>The MAS versions are on sale today and tomorrow only.</strong></p>

<p>I own the Pro version from the MAS.</p>

<p>So, now you know and if I see you putting non-fillable, scanned PDFs on your website, doctor, I will make fun of you. </p>

  <p>Peter, I don’t know how you do it–all the work you do on KM, and still answering many questions in the forum. Just a note from one very appreciative customer.</p>

<p>This was quickly followed by “+1”s. </p>

<p>I have to agree that this echoes my sentiments too. I love KM as excellent software, but the extra work on answering (sometimes silly or rude questions) is really wonderful. </p>

<p>Even better was Peter’s deferential reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks Mike (and others!), your thoughts are greatly appreciated!</p>

  <p>It’s easy to say how I do it - I’m supported by all of you. I get to do what I love, work from home so I can walk my kids to school, make something that is useful to lots of people, and all because you folks all support me, both financially and by helping expand Keyboard Maestro to others.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2013/03/15/The-safety-of-clone-backups.html">Clone Backups - Why and How</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="content"><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>If you have valuable data on your computer you need to have a back up and more than one. Your data is likely priceless, irreplaceable and/or expensive to recover. If you’re anything like me, your data may consist of some of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photos
    <ul>
      <li>Military</li>
      <li>Med school graduation</li>
      <li>Wedding</li>
      <li>Children</li>
      <li>Clinical photos</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Music - entire collection of CDs long burned to digital and thrown away</li>
  <li>Movies
    <ul>
      <li>Home movies</li>
      <li>Hollywood movie rips from old DVDs long thrown away </li>
      <li>Training videos</li>
      <li>Conference talks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documents
    <ul>
      <li>Tax returns</li>
      <li>Business receipts</li>
      <li>Lease agreements </li>
      <li>Scans of all diplomas, licenses, etc. </li>
      <li>All utility bills</li>
      <li>Research papers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>You should back up the data frequently and redundantly. Hard drives do fail. Natural disasters, both weather and children, do happen. <a href="http://m.nydailynews.com/1.247700#bmb=1">Thieves do take things</a>. <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/">Hackers can wipe out everything</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to make multiple continuous backups with at least some of them stored off site. There are many easy and relatively inexpensive ways to do this, but today I just want to talk about one specific type of back up that I think is the most valuable. (<em>You still should do more than one kind.</em>) </p>

<h3 id="clone-backups">Clone Backups</h3>

<p>A clone backup is an identical copy of your hard drive including the operating system and not just the user data. This is a <em>bootable</em> copy of your computer meaning that if your hard drive wears out, gets stolen, is shot, whatever, you can plug your clone in and run it identically to the machine that just died. To be clear, if my drive dies in the middle of clinic, I pull the clone back up out of my bag, plug it in, reboot, and I’m back in business.</p>

<p>Most other forms of back up just back up user data, or are primarily designed to recover small amount of data at a time. While this is nice to have in the situation of catastrophic failure, it doesn’t do me much good if my hard drive dies in the middle of rounds or at conference before I have to give a presentation. </p>

<p>In those situations, I need <em>my</em> machine. I need a clone. </p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p><em>This is for Macs only. I’m sure Windows and Linux have their own software for doing this but I don’t use those products so I can’t make recommendations.</em></p>

<p>There are two excellent and easy to use programs that will make clone back ups for you: <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> and <a href="http://www.bombich.com">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>. They are both excellent and are staples of Mac nerds. I happen to use SuperDuper! but not for any particular reason. They are not available in the Mac App Store because they need very low level access to your computer to make the clone, which is not allowed for MAS apps. I’m always happily surprised when I go to upgrade my OS and their software is already upgraded for the new version. </p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p><em>The hardware is platform agnostic so you can use these on Mac, Windows, or Linux.</em></p>

<p>The other thing you’ll need to make a clone back up is a hard drive. At the bare minimum it needs to be big enough to hold your entire primary hard drive. In addition, I recommend that it be small so that you can carry it with you all the time, and have the fastest port possible for your machine so that the back ups are quick to make. The longer it takes to run, the less likely you are to do it. (<em>Think compliance with QID dosing versus QD dosing.</em>)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Larger than the drive it is cloning</li>
  <li>Small so it is portable</li>
  <li>Fast connection so backups are easier</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to speed there are two types of drives and two major types of connections: SSD vs HDD, and Thunderbolt vs USB 3.0.</p>

<p>SSDs (solid state drives) are newer, faster, and have no moving parts. They are the Ferrari of drives. They also cost as much. HDDs (hard disk drive) are the classic spinning disk drives. They are larger, store more, and are cheaper, but are also slower. </p>

<p>The Thunderbolt connection is an Intel product but so far has really only shown up in Mac computers. It is the fastest consumer external connection, but it is also very expensive. Often drives are sold without the cords, which themselves cost an extra $50. USB 3.0 is very fast compared to the previous generation USB 3.0 and is much cheaper. This is pretty ubiquitous now on new computers from Apple and Windows. </p>

<h4 id="ssd-fast-and-furious-with-a-price-to-match">SSD: fast and furious with a price to match</h4>

<p>If money is no object, I recommend an SSD with either Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 connection, depending on the fastest connection your computer has. The one caveat is that SSDs are typical smaller than HDD and are very expensive a larger sizes. If you have an 500GB+ HDD, then you’ll need to stick with an HDD. However, if like me, you have something like a Macbook Air with a 128 or 256 GB SSD, then this is a great option. For a top-of-the-line, blazingly fast, SSD/Thunderbolt drive, you can get the Elgato 240GB for $480. A really beautiful option, and only a bit slower but much cheaper, is the 240 GB OWC SSD/USB 3.0 <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/ENVPROU3S240/">Envoy Pro EX</a> for $320. (This is probably what I would get if I had the money. It’s not as fast, but way better looking.)</p>

<p>A few cheaper options include the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shadow-trade-240GB-External-Portable/dp/B004G7KK30/?tag=violeneces-20">U32 Shadow 240GB USB 2.0 SSD</a> for $250 and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Verbatim-Store-External-Solid-47622/dp/B008OE0S56/?tag=violeneces-20">Verbatim Store ‘n’ Go 128 GB USB 3.0 SSD</a> for $150.</p>

<h4 id="hdd-steady-and-solid">HDD: steady and solid</h4>

<p>A mid-range choice, and what I use, is a HDD with Thunderbolt connection. HDDs are significantly slower than SSDs but without the prohibitively high price. I can make two clone back ups on separate devices (one for home and one for work, i.e. off site back up) for the price of an SSD and the drives are still large enough for lots of extra storage space in addition. I have/use two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Thunderbolt-Portable-Drive/dp/B008D4X9UI/?tag=violeneces-20">Buffalo MiniStation 1 TB Thunderbolt / USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive with Thunderbolt Cable</a>. This has both the USB 3.0 and the Thunderbolt connections and comes with both cables. The 1TB model is only $208 on Amazon right now and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Thunderbolt-Portable-Drive/dp/B008D4X9UI/?tag=violeneces-20">500GB is $143</a>.</p>

<p>If you drop the Thunderbolt connection for USB 3.0 you can significantly cut the price. A Buffalo drive with only USB 3.0 runs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Plus-Portable-Drive/dp/B005EJLFVK/?tag=violeneces-20">$70 for 500GB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Plus-Portable-Drive/dp/B005EJLFVK/?tag=violeneces-20">$84 for 1TB</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Plus-Portable-Drive/dp/B005EJLFVK/?tag=violeneces-20">$200 for 2 TB</a>.</p>

<p>If you are on a shoe-string budget or only have a USB 2.0 connection then the specific model doesn’t matter as much. You can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Hard-Drive-WDBL1D5000ABK-NESN/dp/B005DKZW5A/?tag=violeneces-20">WD My Passport 500GB USB 2.0</a> but considering you can get a much better drive for $20 more and the speed will be agonizingly slow, I really don’t recommend going this route. The only way I’d do this is if you have hardly any money at all and already own an old USB 2.0 drive.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The first time you run the cloning software, it will take awhile. Depending on your connection it could be an hour to all night. After that it will much faster as it will only incrementally update changes. My updates typically take around 6 minutes. </p>

<p>Enjoy your new power and piece of mind. You just earned +10 nerd CME. </p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2013/03/12/Mute-commercials-on-CBS-or-Hulu-with-Keyboard-Maestro.html">Mute commercials on CBS or Hulu with Keyboard Maestro</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>In a game of one-upmanship, I’ve improved on my prior macros for muting commercials on CBS and Hulu. What used to be 1-3 non-annoying commercials<sup id="fnref:1363103721-fn1"><a href="#fn:1363103721-fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> has turned into five, highly-annoying, commercials in a row. The volume is often much louder than the volume of the show and not infrequently, the same commercial is played all 5 times.</p>

<p>To combat this I made two small changes. First, I combined the two macros into one so I don’t have to remember two hot keys or which site I’m watching. A simple Applescript snippet captures the URL from Chrome and an if/then statement looks for the network name in the url. The second change involves turning the screen off and on in addition to toggling the mute key.</p>

<p>The macro flows thus:</p>

<pre>
- Execute Applescript `tell application "Google Chrome" to get the URL of active tab of first window` and save results to variable `currentURL`
- If `currentURL` contains CBS then
    - Toggle system sound mute
    - Repeat action 16 times: decrease screen brightness
    - Execute following action until none of the conditions are met
        - none (this is basically just a pause until)
        - Conditions: screen contains image (the image is the "advertisement" graphic that is displayed during a commercial)
    - Toggle system sound mute
    - Repeat action 16 times: increase screen brightness
- otherwise execute the following
    - If `currentURL` contains hulu then
        - Toggle system sound mute
        - Repeat action 16 times: decrease screen brightness
        - Execute following action until none of the conditions are met
            - none (this is basically just a pause until)
            - Conditions: screen contains image (the image is the "advertisement" graphic that is displayed during a commercial)
        - Toggle system sound mute
        - Repeat action 16 times: increase screen brightness
    - otherwise do nothing
</pre>

<p>I haven’t figured out a way to automatically call this macro when the commercials start. I could watch for the “advertisement” graphic but I think that would be way too CPU intensive. I’ll keep thinking about it.</p>

<p>I encourage you to make your own macro to learn the system, and you might have to in order to get the correct “advertisement” graphic, but you can get mine <a href="/images/mute_Commercials.kmmacros">here</a>. (right click to download)</p>

  <p>[A] growing number of physicians are taking a cue from their personal lives and using mobile devices to make their jobs more efficient.</p>

<p>Just like “normal people”, physicians want their life to be easier and when they see how technology improves one aspect of their life, they want to see similar improvements in other aspects. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But industry experts predict the road to adoption won’t be easy, as data security, IT integration and looming federal regulations come into play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A constant problem in all areas of medicine, regulations continue to choke the life out of medical practice. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But even as physicians continue to see the benefits of mobile apps in practicing medicine, experts warn the road to full adoption will be long. For starters, health apps and mobile devices present a new privacy and security challenge for hospitals, which operate under tight regulations and strict federal patient privacy laws.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Physicians are driving the need for it. They want to be able to see the data on the phones and iPads, but the hospitals are not jumping on it as quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I got the first iPad, I was told by hospital IT that it “couldn’t connect” to the system. When I figured out how to get it connected, I was told it was “not allowed”. They refused to explain how accessing the system from my laptop at home (fully supported) was different than accessing the system from my iPad as we rounded on patients. Eventually, as more higher level attendings bought the devices for themselves, seeing how useful they were to the residents, the policy changed to “not supported”.

  <p>Another road block to mobile adoption is integration of apps into a hospitals IT system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is because the EMRs that hospitals use are closed, proprietary systems. They are built on old architectural standards. The database systems are closed and or proprietary. There are no APIs. The EMR companies want to keep the system closed to stifle competition. They want to be the only one that can make an app for their system and they charge astronomical prices for mobile apps for their EMRs, often a large percentage of the original cost all over again. </p>

<p>I still remain optimistic that one day cooperate medicine will have and use decent technology, although I’m realistic enough to know this may never happen in my lifetime. Until then, I will continue to develop my own private systems for my every day practice. </p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>First, I have to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci">Federico Viticci</a>, whose <a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/chaining-tweetbot-pythonista-drafts-and-imessage-for-urls/">detailed</a> <a href="http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/from-instapaper-and-pythonista-to-dropbox-and-evernote-as-pdf/">blog</a> <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/automating-ios-how-pythonista-changed-my-workflow/">posts</a> on his use of Pythonista inspired me to use it and learn Python as well. </p>

<p>I don’t use iOS devices as exclusively as he does, but when I am using them I want them to be as powerful and automated as my Mac is. One use case that Federico demonstrated was using Pythonista to take two screen shots (such as of an app before and after an update) and create a new image of both screen shots side by side, such as he might need for an app review blog post. His old script was a bit hacky due to the situation at the time.</p>

<p>Pythonista was <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/pythonista-1-3-brings-camera-roll-and-notification-center-support-new-library-view-and-more/">recently updated</a> to include the ability to pick images from the camera roll from inside Pythonista as well as the ability to save generated images to the camera roll.</p>

<p>I decided to fork his original code to include these features and to remove some options that I don’t need.</p>

<p>When you run this script you will be prompted to choose an image from the camera roll. This will be the image on the left of the combined final image. Then you will be prompted to choose a second image. Naturally, this image will be on the right. The image will be generated and saved to the camera roll.</p>

<p>You can get the script from Gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/nuclearzenfire/5090763">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>"""
This code takes two screenshots from the camera roll combines them into one image and saves the new image to the camera roll.

This is adapted from Federico Viticci's blog post at:
http://www.macstories.net/stories/automating-ios-how-pythonista-changed-my-workflow/
It removes the option to change which picture is where, automatically assigning the first one chosen as the leftmost image.
It also removes the necessity to copy the images to the clipboard outside of Pythonista using the new photos library in version 1.3. Finally, it removes the clipboard output.
"""

import photos
import Image
import console

im1 = photos.pick_image(show_albums=False)
im2 = photos.pick_image(show_albums=False)

background = Image.new('RGBA', (746,650), (255, 255, 255, 255))

console.clear()
print "Generating image..."
console.show_activity()

_1 = im1.resize((366,650),Image.ANTIALIAS)
_2 = im2.resize((366,650),Image.ANTIALIAS)
background.paste(_1,(0,0))
background.paste(_2,(380,0))
photos.save_image(background)
console.hide_activity()
print "Image saved to camera roll."

<p>Here’s an image I created with it for an upcoming comparison of the text-parsing of Pocket vs. Instapaper:</p>

<p><a href="/images/sidebyside.jpg"><img src="/images/sidebyside.jpg" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>Next, I need to make a way for this image to be uploaded to my public Dropbox folder and the public link to be placed in the clipboard.</p>

<p>I can’t wait for more posts by Frederico so I can keep learning.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I love to read and have to read a lot for my work and hobbies, but sometimes, for various reasons, reading is not ideal. Maybe my eyes are tired. Maybe I need to do something physical that precludes the physical act of reading but not the mental aspect.<sup id="fnref:201302261054"><a href="#fn:201302261054" class="footnote">1</a></sup> In those situations, I let my software read to me with text-to-speech. </p>

<h2 id="text-to-speech-on-ios">Text-to-speech on iOS</h2>

<p>Text-to-speech on iOS is already built into the OS. To turn it on go to <code>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Speak Selection</code> and turn it on. You can also switch the dialect if you want.<sup id="fnref:1302260948"><a href="#fn:1302260948" class="footnote">2</a></sup> From now on, when you highlight any text, one of the options on the pop up menu will be “speak”. Hit this and the text will be read to you. There is a major limitation with this: <strong>if you lock the device or switch to a different application, the reading stops.</strong></p>

<p>Another option is a dedicated app. <a href="https://twitter.com/SiMBa37">A colleague</a> recommends <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/voice-dream-reader-text-to/id496177674?mt=8&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">Voice Dream Reader</a> for 10 USD in the App Store. I have not used it so I can’t comment on it.</p>

<h2 id="text-to-speech-on-os-x">Text-to-speech on OS X</h2>

<p>OS X also has built-in text-to-speech software. As far as I can tell, it is always on, but that may be a left over preference on my machine from years back so to check, go to  <code>System Preferences &gt; Dictation &amp; Speech</code>. I also turn on the keyboard shortcut for this. Otherwise, all you need to do is highlight some text, right click, and select <code>Speech &gt; Start Speaking</code>. </p>

<p>I use this frequently when reading an article and I get tired, or I need to be doing something else like cooking at the same time. I’ve also found that just turning this on when reading something important like a medical journal article lets others know I’m doing something work related rather than just surfing the internet for memes, i.e. don’t interrupt. It is also a great way to proof read your writing. What your eyes often miss, your ears will clearly hear.</p>

<h2 id="text-to-speech-os-x-to-ios">Text-to-speech OS X to iOS</h2>

<p>Sometimes there is a very large article I want to read but don’t want to sit at my machine for an extended period to time. Thankfully, OS X has some built in functions that allow you to turn the text into an audio file using the text-to-speech functions. OS X comes with this ability pre-programmed in the services section. To turn it on, go to <code>System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts &gt; Services &gt; Text</code> and make sure <code>Add to iTunes as a Spoken…</code> is checked. From then on, when you have text highlighted, you can right click, go to Services, and click on <code>Add to iTunes as a Spoken…</code>. This will convert the text-to-speech, first as a lossless AIFF (a very large file). It will then re-encode using AAC (to make it a smaller file) and then import into iTunes under a special playlist. </p>

<p>This works fine in general, but I don’t usually sync my iPhone with iTunes as I keep most things in the cloud. Thankfully, Automator<sup id="fnref:1302261013"><a href="#fn:1302261013" class="footnote">3</a></sup> makes it very easy to create your own.<sup id="fnref:201302261023"><a href="#fn:201302261023" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="/images/AutomatorTTS.png"><img src="/images/AutomatorTTS.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>This creates a service for when text is selected. You run it the same as the prior service: right click, go to Services, and click on <code>The Name of the Service</code>. It changes the text to audio format, saving to the location of your choice, and using the voice of your choice. It then re-encodes the file to a format most compatible with spoken word, thus greatly decreasing the file size, and deletes the original file. I have it save to a folder inside Dropbox so that I can play it later (or sooner) on any device I have.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>I had 3000 Pages documents that I wanted to convert PDF. I had previously searched the internet for a way to do this easily but was unsuccessful. I suppose I should have tried searching again, because I would have found <a href="http://www.yourmacteacher.com/batch-convert-pages-documents-to-pdf/">Pages2PDF</a>, which works much better than what I did. </p>

<p>Still, relying on someone to create the exact program you need is not as fun or as useful as being able to fix the problem yourself. So I created a Keyboard Maestro macro.</p>

<p>Basically, this automates the steps I would have had to do manually:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the file in Pages.</li>
  <li>Select Export to PDF from the menu.</li>
  <li>Fix the file name.<sup id="fnref:130218165655"><a href="#fn:130218165655" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Move the original file to a new location.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Keyboard Maestro parlance the steps were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For Each Item in a the Finder’s selection
    <ol>
      <li>Set the file name to a variable fileName</li>
      <li>Set the file path to a variable filePath</li>
      <li>Open the file at filePath/fileName<sup id="fnref:130218170000"><a href="#fn:130218170000" class="footnote">2</a></sup> in Pages.</li>
      <li>Pause for 1.5 seconds.<sup id="fnref:130218170107"><a href="#fn:130218170107" class="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
      <li>Select the menu item PDF… in the submenu Export in the Menu Title File.</li>
      <li>Press the Button labeled “Next…”</li>
      <li>Insert the text from variable %WindowName%1% by pasting. (Basically, this names the file being exported the same as the original file name, except for the extension.)</li>
      <li>Press the button labeled “Export”.</li>
      <li>Type the keystroke ?-W (to close the open file)</li>
      <li>Move the file %Variable%filePath%/%Variable%fileName% to whateverLocationYouWant/%Variable%fileName%</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It worked perfectly if somewhat slow. It took several hours to process all the files. </p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>A colleague of mine wanted a way to easily document the NIH stroke scale score with the added benefits of not having to type the whole thing each time, prompts to remember what to evaluate and what the scores mean, and also have the final score calculated for him. Requirements included that the input had to be in TextExpander due to a preference for that applications input style, and the output would have to be in the middle of a Pages document that was using a single font and no bold or italics.</p>

<p>He had already created the TextExpander snippet and basically needed me to figure out a way to use KM to calculate the score and put it into the note. Oh, one more thing: He wanted to do this with only one command. </p>

<h2 id="challenge-accepted">Challenge accepted!</h2>

<p>The KM macro first types out the shortcut for the TE macro, which calls the TE snippet pop up window, and then pauses until the TE snippet window disappears. </p>

<p>The TE window has all the steps of the NIH Stroke Scale including prompts to remind the user how to do it correctly.</p>

<p><a href="/images/NIH_stroke_TE_menu.png"><img src="/images/NIH_stroke_TE_menu.png" alt="NIH Stroke Scale TE Menu" /></a> </p>

<p>Once the TE part is complete, the KM macro continues. All it really does it use regular expressions to find the individual numbers in the scale and add them together for the final score. Since the final score is really just simple addition of 15 single digit numbers, the whole exercise is a bit of a Rube Goldberg, but it was fun anyway and any less brain power and time needed at 2 in the morning during a stroke is probably a good thing.</p>

<p>And the final result:</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>I love tech and I especially love software, but like most things that we deeply love, when they fall short, it’s very hard to not get angry.</p>

<p>This is one reason I have such a hatred for the current state of Electronic Medical Records. They’re abysmal. <a href="http://vimeo.com/31926572">John Gruber even makes fun of them</a>. (Minute 24:28, but the whole talk is worth listening too.)</p>

<p>Today I share <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/stupid-emr-ui">another example</a> of poor design.</p>

<p>In the EMR I use now, NextGen, I’ve been complaining about the joint injection procedure template for 1.5 years. They still haven’t fixed it.</p>

<p>I use a standard medication called Synvisc One. Synvisc regular is a 2ml (16mg) injection you give once a week for 3 weeks. Synvisc One is all 6ml (48mg) given at once.</p>

<p>Just to lay out all the numbers for you. This medication is available as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2ml</li>
  <li>6ml</li>
  <li>16mg</li>
  <li>48mg</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Two strengths. Expressed either in a volume or a mass.</p>

<p>You can document this in two places in the procedure template. I want to point out, that this is the first mistake, having two places to document one thing.</p>

<p>And here’s how they look:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Synvisc_Nextgen_order_1.png" alt="" /> </p>

<p>First, there’s no units. Specifically it just says “units”. Is that milliliters? Liters? Milligrams? Grams? Number of injections? Is this for Synvisc or Synvisc One? If I pick one of these, what am I actually documenting or ordering? The closest guess is that this is in milliliters, but then you can’t pick “6”, the size of Synvisc One. There is a “2”, so you could document Synvisc regular. Even then, <strong>1 in 5 available choices will always be wrong</strong>. Why even offer a possible wrong choice?!?! I also point out that this is a pop up menu, so you’ve already been removed from the screen you’re working on.</p>

<p>And here is how the second place to document it looks: </p>

<p><img src="/images/Synvisc_Nextgen_order_2.png" alt="" /> </p>

<p>This one at least has units, but still has all the other problems. </p>

<p>I would offer the following fixes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have only one place to order the drug.</li>
  <li>Instead of a pop up window, make it a radial button choice. </li>
  <li>Have two options: Synvisc and Synvisc One</li>
</ol>

<p>This improve things as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Only one place to document. </li>
  <li>No choices that are wrong.</li>
  <li>No extra pop up menu.</li>
  <li>No need for the user to know the milligrams, milliliters, or any other unit. They just need to be able to read what is on the box.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope that before I die<sup id="fnref:1301182110"><a href="#fn:1301182110" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, a decent EMR exists. </p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>This post is mostly for me, so I can remember how I did this in the future.</p>

<p>I was creating show notes for a podcast I do. I needed to make a list of links to scientific papers. Even using Markdown rather than HTML it took me an insanely long amount of time to manually copy over the titles and links. So I decided I’d spend the next hour never doing that again.</p>

<p>First, I figured out a way to get the links easily. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> does not have a way to easily copy out the information directly, but it does have a way to highlight all the papers you want to link and open them all in tabs in your browser.</p>

<p>Now that I had all the papers open in their own tab, I needed a way to make Markdown links from them. I thought I had read something about doing this before, but I couldn’t find it again<sup id="fnref:1301132310"><a href="#fn:1301132310" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I did find <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/07/markdown-reference-links-from-safari-tabs/">a post by Dr. Drang</a> that got me halfway there. The only problem was that his method only gave me the second half of a list of reference links when what I wanted was inline links with the title of the webpage as the text.</p>

<p>His technique gave me this:</p>

<pre><code>[1]: website url
[2]: website url
[3]: website url
[4]: website url
</code></pre>

<p>When what I wanted was this:</p>

<pre><code>[Website Title](website url)
[Website Title](website url)
[Website Title](website url)
[Website Title](website url)
</code></pre>

<p>I like reference links too, but I needed the title of the paper for my purposes and I already have another macro that I use to turn inline links into reference links later.</p>

<p>My Applescript knowledge is weak, but I quickly found <a href="http://lucifr.com/2012/09/01/selected-safari-tabs-to-markdown-reference-links/">this page</a>, which I can’t read because it’s in Chinese, and by looking at the code, figured out how to get what I needed.</p>

<p>I changed Dr. Drang’s original code:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Safari"
  set i to 1
  set links to ""
  repeat with t in every tab in front window
    set links to links &amp; "[" &amp; i &amp; "]: " &amp; the URL of t &amp; linefeed
    set i to i + 1
  end repeat
  return links
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Safari"
  set i to 1
  set links to ""
  repeat with t in every tab in front window
    set links to links &amp; "[" &amp;the name of t&amp; "](" &amp; the URL of t &amp;")"&amp; linefeed
    set i to i + 1
  end repeat
  return links
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>You can then throw that into a TextExpander snippet or a Keyboard Maestro Macro and you’re prestige.</p>

<p>Frankly, Papers needs a way to do this in the app itself.</p>

<p>The macro is a very simple three steps.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2012/11/25/Podcasting-with-Squarespace.html">Podcasting with Squarespace</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="content"><h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>If you want to create a podcast, Squarespace is recommended as a complete solution for domain registration, hosting, bandwidth, and syndication. They even have a dedicated <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/customer/portal/articles/637686-podcasting-with-squarespace">instruction manual</a>. <strong>Update: The lack of analytics regarding total number of downloads for each episode of a podcast is a weakness, especially if you want to get sponsors.</strong></p>

<h1 id="tldr">tl:dr</h1>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>I recently decided to make a podcast. This was to be a small hobby, a minor side project, and so the technical aspects of the project couldn’t take up much of my time and energy. As I was preparing the content and looking at the best ways to turn this into a reality, it appeared that Squarespace could possibly be able to handle all the hosting, bandwidth, and even the domain registration. It turns out that this is correct and for the most part was quite easy.</p>

<p>I’ve used Squarespace before for several sites. Mostly I’ve used version 5 and haven’t quite gotten into version 6 yet. My past experience has been that they are very helpful with tech support the few times I’ve needed it, are very generous with long, free trials to test out the service, and are not pushy sales people. In fact, I’m not sure if they have sales people. They don’t even ask for your credit card number up front! These are decent folk.</p>

<p>Before I got started, I did have one question related to doing a podcasting site. On their <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/pricing/">pricing page</a> it stated that the maximum file size is 20mb; however, on <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/customer/portal/articles/637686-podcasting-with-squarespace">another page specifically about podcasting</a>, it stated the maximum size is 120mb. Well, which is it? This is the kind of straight forward question that if I normally ask a support person, they have no idea what I’m talking about, and if they even bother to compare the urls I send them, then never know what I’m talking about. My experience with the Squarespace support was the exact opposite. </p>

<p>I clicked on the support chat link on their website, was immediately helped by someone pleasant whose name I don’t remember and told simply that the normal limit is 20mb, but specifically for podcasting, it increases to 120mb. Perfect. With that verification, I was ready to go.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>First, at least mentally, I needed a domain. Squarespace gives you a free domain if you sign up for a year. Check.</p>

<p>Second, I needed a website. Well, that is the basic service of of Squarespace. I picked a template that was close to what I had imagined. It didn’t take me long to have a working prototype and over the next several days was able to turn it into something I was happy with. Honestly, I have no design or artistic sense, so it is a real testament to Squarespace’s platform that I was able to do this.</p>

<p>Third, I needed an RSS feed for my podcast that I can serve to podcast apps and to iTunes. Simply, Squarespace has already handled that. All you do is create a “blog” page, i.e. a single page that you can add sequential entries to. Then, when you have a podcast episode to publish, you create a blog entry and in that entry add an “audio block” which automagically creates a podcast feed. Squarespace takes care of the syndication and even puts a streaming player into that post. In addition, they have a preference to enable iTunes options so that it can be compatible  with and submitted to iTunes.</p>

<p>Fourth, I needed hosting for the podcast files. You can host them elsewhere such as <a href="http://libsyn.com">libsyn</a> or it may be possible depending on the size of your episodes and the number of downloads to get by with their cheaper plan with 500 GB of bandwidth and 2 GB of storage<sup id="fnref:121125232343"><a href="#fn:121125232343" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I wanted to splurge so I went for their unlimited place with unlimited bandwidth and storage<sup id="fnref:121125235024"><a href="#fn:121125235024" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. The storage is relatively easy for the most part. You upload your podcast audio file in the previously mentioned “audio block” and save it like you would any normal webpage.  </p>

<p>And just like that, I have a podcast.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>If I had to do it again, I wouldn’t even look for another alternative. It was great. Still, there are some rough edges that could be honed.</p>

<p>First, the file upload process for non-picture/audio/video files is so well hidden, I didn’t think it existed. If you want to upload a file like a PDF to your site, it is possible, but I doubt you’d ever find it on your own. When you are editing a page, the normal behavior is to click a plus sign button to add a block (widget). There are blocks for text, picture, audio, video, horizontal rules, and even blank space. There is no block for generic files. I clicked around for quite a while trying to figure it out. The answer is you first choose the text block, click on the “link” button as if you were going to make a text link, and in the next dialogue box is a place to upload a file. This seems to me to be a very unintuitive and misleading place to burry the file upload function. </p>

<p>Second, but related, there is no place to easily manage all your files. While you can access some of them from that same dialogue box, you cannot access them all. For example, after creating a podcast episode, I wanted to create a direct link in that post to the file for some that were having trouble getting it to play (IE 6, seriously?). There was no way that I could find in the interface to get access to this file in order to link it, or even just get its file name. I had to look at the source code of the rendered webpage to grab it.</p>

<p>These are two small, but significant problems that were so glaringly bad functionally that I have a hard time believing that they came from the same people who made the rest of the site so good.</p>

<p>Third, when selecting text to be edited in the “edit post” window, if the cursor went outside of the box after selecting text, the window exited the editing mode. </p>

<p>Fourth, when editing text in the “edit post” window, there are certain keystrokes that will cause the window to suddenly and glaringly jump to the bottom right of the screen for a 1/2 second and then return to the center. This happens, for example, when you type some text and hit the backspace key. This must be a frequent sequence of events unless no one else makes typos like I do. Again, this seems like an obvious bug that I’m surprised it hasn’t been fixed. </p>

<p>Again, overall, a great experience, I’d do it again, and I’m looking forward to using their platform for my podcast. Also, I think I’m finally ready to upgrade by Squarespace 5 site to version 6…next weekend.</p>

<p>Scan documents with your smartphone, sync to your home computer with Dropbox, and have them automatically OCR’d so they’re searchable later.</p>

<h1 id="tldr">tl;dr</h1>

<p>Yesterday, I mentioned that one of the consistent apps on my home screen is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a>. It is a simple and elegant app with a straight forward purpose: take pictures of documents, save them as PDFs, and upload them to cloud-based services. </p>

<p>In the digital age in which many of us are trying to live a <a href="http://macsparky.com/paperless/" title="Paperless">Paperless</a> lifestyle, converting paper documents to digital ones is a necessary evil. Scanners of various types are necessary for this task. There is a continuum of power versus portability when it comes to scanners. The more powerful are less portable; the most portable are usually not that powerful. </p>

<p>At work, where I don’t need to be portable, but need lots of power to scan hundreds of pages of double-sided documents and auto-rotate the occasional upside down page, I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-Instant-Sheet-Fed-Macintosh/dp/B001XWCQO2?tag=violeneces-20">Fujistu ScanSnap S1500M</a>, and I wouldn’t want to use anything else. At home, where I’m a bit more portable, and typically am only scanning a few pages at once, I go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doxie-Go-Rechargeable-Mobile-Scanner/dp/B0053TRH2M/ref=sr_1_1?tag=violeneces-20">Doxie Go</a>, which I can also take with me on trips if needed. </p>

<p>But then there are all the times when I’m not at work or home but want to scan something and that’s when I turn to the power of the modern smartphone camera and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a>. </p>

<p>I have three requirements when I scan documents. </p>

<p>First, all documents must be in PDF format. PDF is a universal standard that will not be going away anytime soon, and if it does every become obsolete, there are so many people that have depended on it, there will be many options created to convert PDFs to the next standard. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a> saves all images in this format. </p>

<p>Next, I need to be able to access to my documents from any of my devices. This means uploading them to <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">Dropbox</a>. If you don’t know what Dropbox is stop everything now and <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">go learn</a>. <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">Seriously</a>. Stop! Don’t read another word. <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">GO</a>. <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">GET</a>. <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">DROPBOX</a>. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a> can upload to Dropbox (and a bunch of other Cloud services I don’t use) and can be set to upload automatically.</p>

<p>Finally, all my documents must be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR’d</a>. Basically, OCR is the process by which software is used to analyze the image of a document and figure out what the characters are. Without OCR you have an unsearchable document that you can’t even copy and paste text out of. With OCR you can search for any words inside the document and copy and paste text from it elsewhere. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a> does not OCR, and frankly, I’m suspicious of any mobile OCR app at this time. I really want quality text conversion and so I prefer to use the more powerful software and processor on my desktop machine. </p>

<p>To OCR documents uploaded to <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">Dropbox</a>, I have my home computer watch the folder I upload PDFs to from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a>, and when a new PDF is added, an Applescript is called that uses <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpenpro/id403758325?mt=12">PDFpen Pro</a> to OCR the document. All credit goes to David Sparks, AKA MacSparky, author of the aforementioned <a href="http://macsparky.com/paperless/" title="Paperless ebook">Paperless ebook</a>, for the technique to do this. <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2009/5/24/pdfpen-ocr-folder-action-script.html">He wrote about</a> using something called Folder Actions that he used to do this. In the comments of this post<sup id="fnref:121124223240"><a href="#fn:121124223240" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, there was a link to another site that did a similar thing using Hazel. <a href="http://www.documentsnap.com/hazel-rule-to-ocr-documents-using-pdfpen/">I use the Hazel method</a>, because I actually have many folders that are watched and OCR’d in a similar way, and having them all together in one application makes them easier to monitor.</p>

<p>So, when I’m returning the rental car at the end of a business trip, rather than saving the receipt for scanning at home fraught with the perils of trying not to wrinkle it in the carry on bag and also remember to scan it in the first place, I take a quick picture of it with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a> and forget about it, because it will be uploaded and OCR’d without any more input from me. The next time I need the receipt, I just search for “car rental receipt” in Spotlight and all those kinds of receipts appear.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2012/11/23/quitting-ascension.html">It's not me, it's you.</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>I received a piece of mail today that I found insulting: my employer has hired an outside agency to determine if my son is my son.</p>

<p>Actually and technically, since my wife and I both work in the same company and the insurance is in her name, the letter was to my wife and was to verify that I am her husband and that our son is ours.</p>

<p>Riddled with corporate speak, this letter basically says that they don’t trust that everyone listed as a dependent–myself and my son–on my wife’s insurance is actually a dependent and that they want to make sure they aren’t paying for what they don’t have to be. Apparently, this is a company-wide initiative.</p>

<p>While I have no problem with companies verifying that there is no fraud occurring in their organization, I have multiple reasons to be upset with this letter.</p>

<p>First, in order to verify our status, this third party organization that I am not associated with in any way is demanding a copy of my marriage license, tax return with both our names on it, and my son’s birth certificate. If I don’t provide it to them in 2 weeks, we’ll lose our health insurance.</p>

<p>I’m not a low level corporate stooge. My wife and I were professionally recruited to this organization. We were interviewed by CEOs and COOs. The in-house recruiter helped find a school for my son. I have meetings regularly with my office manager, the regional manager, and the COO. The idea that this small family, 2/3’s of whom are salaried employees of the company, cannot be locally verified is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Also, there’s no reason that every employee shouldn’t be granted the same respect and it would not be difficult to do as I’ll explain later. </p>

<p>Second, our organization is infested with managers. It would take very little effort to have us present the same documentation to our local managers, who could feed this up the food chain. It’s the same way they verify we all get our yearly flu shots or have maintained our licenses. This way, the private information remains local and within the organization I work for and the money that the organization is paying out would be saved. At a time when the organization is performing mass lay offs and crying about how they are losing money, I cannot believe they are wasting money like this.</p>

<p>Finally, given the nature of my work, I cannot just quit if I don’t like the policy. I must give 6 months notice of termination. So, if I don’t give them this information, at the best, I would give up my employee health insurance, which is a part of my compensation package. I’m not sure if this would qualify as breach of contract on their part, and I don’t want to be a trouble maker and fight to find out. </p>

<p>What I do know: my resignation letter will be on my manager’s desk Monday morning. </p>

<p>Sadly, that will not be because of a sudden, principled stand against this issue. Less dramatically, I’ve been contemplating leaving for some time due to other issues like this.</p>

<p>I am taking this as a lesson for when I am the boss and hopefully treat my employees with more respect.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>PDF Expert for iPhone is a great app, and for today is free. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">Get it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>I’m a big fan of the iOS development company <a href="http://readdle.com/products/">Readdle</a> because I use their apps constantly in my personal and work life. <a href="http://readdle.com/products/">Their apps</a> are beautiful, consistently updated, and insanely good. I’ve also bought other company’s competing apps but due to various problems, I stick with Readdle and both PDF Expert and Scanner Pro are have long-standing positions on my home screen.</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/2012-11-23%2013.54.20.png"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/2012-11-23%2013.54.20.png" alt="" height="568" width="320" /></a></p>

<p>I have used PDF Expert on my iPhone and iPad to study for boards, read journal articles, and complete applications for medical licensure, hospital privileges, condo rental, and private school for my son.</p>

<p>Today, in honor of Black Friday, they’ve dramatically cut the prices on their apps, including making <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert for the iPhone free</a>. Personally, I just bought PDF Converter.<sup id="fnref:121123135732"><a href="#fn:121123135732" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There is way too much to talk about with regards to how great some of their apps are, and I have several blog posts planned to discuss how I use some of their apps in my workflow, but I do want to share one small aspect of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert</a> that demonstrates the attention to detail in these apps.</p>

<p>I read a lot of science articles that are in 2 column PDF format. On the iPhone, and even the iPad sometimes, the screen is too small to read more than a single column at a time. A lot of PDF readers screw up the scrolling when going from the end of one page to the beginning of the next. Most of the time, when you are zoomed in on the bottom right corner of the page, when you scroll to the next page, you are either looking at the top right corner of the next page (if scrolling to the next page vertically), or the bottom left (if scrolling horizontally). <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert</a> gets it right by going right to the next text you’ll be wanting to read at the top left of the page in either vertical or horizontal scrolling. </p>

<p>This is better understood with a picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/PDF%20expert%20screen%20scroll.gif"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/PDF%20expert%20screen%20scroll.gif" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Two other top apps for reading PDFs in my field are <a href="http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> and <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/iPhone/index.html">PDFpen</a> both of which have versions for the Mac, iPad, and iPhone. </p>

<p>Papers scrolls horizontally and goes to the bottom right of the next page–area 6 in the above image. While it is the top app for scientific article management, and I highly recommend using it, I don’t recommend using it for reading PDFs. </p>

<p>PDFpen’s behavior changes based if you’ve ever been on the page you’re scrolling to before. If you’ve never been there, it actually zooms out to look at the whole page. If you have been to that page before, it goes back to whatever zoom at whatever location you were at before. This inconsistent behavior is annoying. I would like it if it just zoomed to the whole page view and this was a preference you could toggle, but as it is, like most of the implementations of PDFpen, I find it unusable.<sup id="fnref:121123141713"><a href="#fn:121123141713" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So, if you need to read PDFs and even edit them, including signing documents and mailing them back, go get PDF Expert today.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2012/10/13/Saving-sequential-webpages-with-Keyboard-Maestro.html">Saving sequential webpages as PDFs with Keyboard Maestro</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>I needed to save as PDF a series of 80 webpages on a slow server on a password protected website. I could have sat there for an hour doing it manually, but since I wanted to get dressed and have a cup of coffee, I made a Keyboard Macro shortcut instead.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Saving_with_KM.png"><img src="/images/Saving_with_KM.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>In order to use this macro, you need to set up a very useful shortcut for saving files to PDF. In the stock OS, you hit ⌘-P (Command-P) to bring up the print dialogue box and then in the bottom left hand corner of the pop up menu click the down arrow by PDF and choose save as PDF. <strong>A much faster way  to do this,</strong> is to create a system shortcut that allows you to hit ⌘-P twice to initiate the save as PDF action. I learned this from MacSparky and <a href="http://macsparky.com/2008/3/19/keyboard-shortcut-for-save-as-pdf-in-os-x.html" title="still go to his page every time to remember how to set it up">still go to his page every time to remember how to set it up</a>.</p>

<p>The first two steps are to set up some incrementing variables to allow the files to be named with sequential numbers. If the webpages you’re saving have unique names, this won’t be necessary, but for my case it was.<sup id="fnref:1210130817"><a href="#fn:1210130817" class="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>

<p>The rest of the code is in a repeat loop. Since I knew it was going to be exactly 80 repeats, it was easier to do it this way than a while, or if loop. </p>

<p>The first part of the real code is to initiate the save as command with ⌘-P twice.</p>

<p>Then the file name is entered with the last digit being placed by a variable that will increment by +1 with every new name. Since the saving dialog seemed to take awhile, I added a pause into the mix. Then ⌘-down arrow moves the whole webpage to the very bottom where the “next page” button is. Keyboard Maestro has a powerful function to find images on a webpage and then use that image. In this case, when it sees the image of the next button, it left clicks the mouse in the center of the button. </p>

<p>The pages are slow to load, so I have a pause in there until the screen contains the image of a circular arrow. This is the refresh button in Safari and only shows up once a page is loaded. It’s an easy hack to make sure the next page is loaded. </p>

<p>And then this cycle repeats itself until all the pages were saved. It worked perfectly.</p>

<p>I didn’t even have time to do my hair and finish my coffee.</p>

      <p>Setting the constant 1 to the variable i was probably unnecessary, but I was trying to get this done quickly, not elegantly.  <a href="#fnref:1210130817" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>Bashing Apple’s maps is the thing to do these days, but I just want to share my own Google Maps story. </p>

<p>When I was looking to move to Nashville two years ago I started looking for jobs by looking at hospitals I found on Google maps. There was one hospital on the map that I could never find contact information for. I never thought much about it until I moved there and happened to live right next door. It was strange because there was no hospital there.</p>

<p>For the next year and a half I tried everything I could to get that location unlisted as a hospital. I reported the problem multiple times as a user, I joined their map group and submitted the change manually, and I emailed the Google maps peoples repeatedly. Attempt after attempt was rejected. To this day the location is listed as a hospital with a pink background and a giant <code>H</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Photo_Sep_20,_3_42_04_PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>THERE IS NO HOSPITAL THERE.</strong></p>

<p>You can see the same <a href="https://maps.google.com/?ll=36.142896,-86.816781&amp;spn=0.002876,0.003964&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all" title="problem on the non-mobile version">problem on the non-mobile version</a>. <strong>Update 1.15.2013: This has been fixed.</strong></p>

<p>Even more amusing, if you look at the location in Google Maps and enable photos, you’ll see a photo I took of the building’s sign. It’s clearly an office building and not a hospital.</p>

<p>Apple Maps does not list a hospital at this location.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p><strong>Update 2 (5.23.2013):</strong> When my friend updated to Keyboard Maestro 6, this fix stopped working. This may be because the filter line endings had nothing to do with the fix, rather that process had an unexpected side effect of changing rich text to plain text. We are in the process of testing this theory. If you can’t wait, try filtering with “remove styles”.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/psufka">@psufka</a> reports that he has seen this with Windows machines, so apparently is not an isolated Mac compatibility issue.</p>

<p>A colleague  and friend was having trouble with the Epic electronic medical record. He writes his notes in Pages on the Mac and when he would try to paste the text into Epic, it would mess up. What he was seeing was his note was losing words and the paragraph formatting was screwed up. It was making his life painful, slow, and frustrating…basically like all EMRs make life.</p>

<p><strong>Thankfully, there’s a really simple solution</strong></p>

<p>What was happening (I think) was that he was pasting text from a Mac environment into a Unix environment, <a href="http://www.editpadpro.com/tricklinebreak.html">which have different (invisible) characters to end a line</a>.<sup id="fnref:1208051113"><a href="#fn:1208051113" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> has a function to change the line endings of whatever text is in the clipboard. So now, he copies the text to the clipboard using ⌘-C, switches to the EMR, and ⌃⌘-V pastes the correctly formatted text into the EMR without any screw ups.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pastingIntoEpic.png" alt="Epic pasting KM macro" /> </p>

<p>The same thing was also happening with another EMR he uses, Allscripts. The same solution worked there too.</p>

<p>Keyboard Maestro is a very powerful application for the Mac. I can’t begin to say how great it is. It is also not for beginners. If you’re looking to get started with taking more control over your machine, this is not the place I’d recommend starting unless you have a strong familiarity with computers and have someone to help you along the way. Otherwise, it’s very much worth it’s price of $36.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>In part 1, I tried to explain what TextExpander was and why a physician might want to use it as a force multiplier by showing a few examples of macros that I use daily.</p>

<p><a href="/2012/01/30/TextExpander-for-physicians-part-1.html">TextExpander for physicians, Part 1</a></p>

<p>In part 2, I will cover special codes, syncing between computers, and iOS apps.
## Special codes</p>

<h3 id="time-and-date">Time and Date</h3>

<p>Special codes are text you can put into a macro that tells TextExpander to do something other than just type out the characters. The simplest example is their Time/Date codes. Inside the macro that creates my consult note template is some characters that automatically inserts that day’s date into the note. Instead of having to type, and remember, the date every time I start a new note, the macro does it for me. <code>ddate = %B %e, %Y = February 1, 2012</code> There are numerous permutations of this code so you can create the date however you want.</p>

<p>Time codes are also helpful at times. There are many codes to document the time exactly as you might need it but the built in macro that comes pre-created is <code>time = %1I:%M %p = 9:04 PM</code>. I have discovered two useful cases for this. The first is documenting how much time I spend on a patient and how much of that time is in counseling and coordination. Keeping track of time is only going to happen if it’s easy. This macro makes it very easy. As I walk into a room, I tap the code “ttime”. When I finish the history and exam, while the patient is getting their clothes back on and I’m finishing up my note, I hit it again, “ttime”. And when I’m done with my counseling I hit it a final time. Now I know how long my visit was and if over 50% of that time was in counseling. This allows me to track my time spent per patient so I can better plan my schedule. If I’m taking 20 minutes per patient, but only scheduling 15 minutes, obviously I need to change my schedule. Also, if over 50% of my time is in counseling, then I can bill by time rather than by the traditional coding levels.</p>

<p>I’ve also used this lately to keep track of how long it takes to make phone calls to patients. I’ve been surprised how long the typical call lasts and by having this data, I can more accurately plan my schedule, bill and allocate resources.</p>

<p>TextExpander also comes with some codes for date and time math. Most of my follow ups and planning takes place at regular intervals: every 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks, 12 months or 24 months. This may apply to the next follow up appointment, lab check, infusion time, TB test or DXA scan. While it is easy to say “follow up for labs in 8 weeks”, this abstractness appears to be poorly mentally processed. Being more concrete fixes this problem.</p>

<pre><code>.8wfu = Follow up in 8 weeks (around March 28, 2012). 
</code></pre>

<p>More complicated structures wouldn’t be that difficult to create.</p>

<pre><code>.inrchecks = Check INR on 2/4/12, 2/7/12, 2/10/12, and 2/13/12 (Monday).
</code></pre>

<p>All the dates and the day of the week in that last macro are automatically calculated.</p>

<p>Are you a hospitalist with a patient needs neurochecks every 4 hours?</p>

<pre><code>.q4nchecks = Neuro checks q4 hours (01:33, 05:33, 09:33, 13:33, 17:33, 21:33). 
</code></pre>

<h3 id="fill-ins">Fill ins</h3>

<p>Another special code is the fill in. <code>%fill:name%</code>. This has the macro prompt you to enter text that will be inserted into the text when the macro is created. For example, you might have a macro that prompts for a follow up time.</p>

<pre><code>.fut = Return to clinic in %fill:numberofweeks% weeks.
</code></pre>

<p>This creates the following prompt:</p>

<p><a href="/images/textexpander_fut.png"><img src="/images/textexpander_fut.png" alt="fill in prompt" /></a> </p>

<p>Enter the desired time:</p>

<p><a href="/images/textexpander_fut_2.png"><img src="/images/textexpander_fut_2.png" alt="macro filled in" /></a> </p>

<p>Hit “enter” and your text appears:</p>

<p><a href="/images/textexpander_fut_3.png"><img src="/images/textexpander_fut_3.png" alt="Macro completes" /></a>  </p>

<p>I use this all the time for form letters and consult note templates. For each different fill in, you need to change “name” in <code>%fill:name%</code> to a unique identifier. Or, if you leave it the same, whatever you put in one place, will appear in all the others with the same phrase. For example, in my consult note, I don’t have to retype the patient’s name, consulting physician or reason for consult/chief complaint:</p>

<p><a href="/images/consultnote_macro.png"><img src="/images/consultnote_macro.png" alt="consult note macro" /></a> </p>

<h3 id="copy-clipboard">Copy clipboard</h3>

<p>Another special code is the “clipboard”, <code>%clipboard</code>. This inserts whatever is copied to your clipboard. I use this more for non-medical uses, like writing code or html but the one place I use it regularly in medicine is when saving my notes to file. I use a file name structure that is “Patient Name” and “date of visit.” Using the code <code>%clipboard %1m.%e.%Y</code> and making sure to copy (Command-C) the name from my note to the clipboard before keying the macro, I save a lot of time saving files.</p>

<pre><code>.nd = James Bond 2.1.2012.pages
</code></pre>

<h3 id="cursor-placement">Cursor placement</h3>

<p>The final special code I’ll mention is the cursor placement. <code>%|</code> (That’s percent pipe.) puts your cursor wherever you want with in the text that the macro creates. For short macros, this isn’t needed, but when I use my consult note template, I don’t need the cursor at the end of the document, requiring me to scroll back up to the first page to start typing. Instead, I place it in the History of present illness, so I can start typing what the patient is telling me immediately:</p>

<p><a href="/images/James_Bond_note.png"><img src="/images/James_Bond_note.png" alt="James Bonds note" /></a> </p>

<p>It’s a little thing, but you add up all the little things and the time and convenience are incredible.</p>

<h2 id="syncing-between-computers">Syncing between computers</h2>

<p>Once you have created a lot of macros, your library is going to become a valuable commodity. You will become dependent on these macros and feel lost without them. You will want to make sure you back up your library as well as have it available on any computer you may use. Thankfully, the developers of TextExpander have enabled backing up and syncing of your library through <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. If you don’t know what Dropbox is<sup id="fnref:1202012211"><a href="#fn:1202012211" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, stop reading immediately and go get it. </p>

<p>Now that you have Dropbox and have enabled syncing in the preferences of the TextExpander app, your library of macros will auto-magically appear on any computer<sup id="fnref:1202012213"><a href="#fn:1202012213" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that you’ve also synced using Dropbox. This also works with the iPhone and iPad versions of the applications.</p>

<p>In fact, I have a friend who writes all his clinic notes in TextExpander Touch on his iPad using a bluetooth keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="ios-apps">iOS apps</h2>

<p>TextExpander Touch, the version of the app available for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, is quite good as well, but a bit limited due to restrictions of the operating system. The main restriction is that you cannot use the app to expand text just anywhere in iOS. TextExpander Touch will only work in apps that are specifically enabled to use it. Thankfully, there are a lot of <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/touch/apps/">those apps</a>. The apps also have a built in text editor, so you can write notes there and then copy and paste them or email them elsewhere. It is slightly limiting but nice to have. I tend to use this more for taking notes in meetings and at dinner meetings, when taking out a laptop—even one as small as a Macbook Air—would be overly distracting to others.</p>

<hr />

<p>Well, that’s enough for tonight. In the next, and hopefully final, part, I will finish up by laying out ideas for macros to use in your practice, keys to creating shortcuts you can remember, non-medical uses of macros and advantages of a stand alone applications versus the built-in functionality that some EMRs have.</p>

          <a class="post-link" href="/2012/01/30/TextExpander-for-physicians-part-1.html">TextExpander for physicians, Part 1</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>As a physician I write a lot.<sup id="fnref:1201301814"><a href="#fn:1201301814" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Most of my writing is the same or similar to things I’ve written before and will write again. Repeatedly typing the same things character by character is a waste of time, energy and cartilage. In order to turn my 70 word per minute<sup id="fnref:1201302145"><a href="#fn:1201302145" class="footnote">2</a></sup> into hundreds of words per minute without ended up as a patient myself, I engage a force multiplier, TextExpander.</p>

<p>TextExpander is a text macro program. Simply put, you type a few characters and the program outputs quite a bit more characters. In the last 6 months of use, it’s saved me from typing over 1/2 a million characters, saving an estimated 24 hours of time based on 70 words per minute or at a more typical physician rate of 40 words per minutes, it’s saved me almost 2 solid days of typing.</p>

<p>But like all beautiful things there’s so much more than that.</p>

<h3 id="personal-history">Personal history</h3>

<p>I’ve been using text macros since junior high school. When writing a history day paper, instead of typing “Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry”, I typed CMCP and the whole name would spring forth. I was able to do with with the built-in functionality of the version of MS Word I was using at the time, but I don’t think it was truly a marco function rather than a hack that I created using the automatic spell corrector. </p>

<p>In college, it became even more handy. Instead of typing out long chemical names like Co<sub>1-x</sub>Ni<sub>x</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>·2H<sub>2</sub>O or Fe[S<sub>2</sub>CN(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>Cl, I’d type CN2H or FSCCl. Not only did that save a lot of characters but it also saved me all the clicks in getting the subscript on the right characters.</p>

<p>In medicine, the problem is even more obvious. The combination of redundancy, complexity and speed make a text macro program a powerful ally.</p>

<h3 id="medical-application">Medical application</h3>

<p>The first macros I created were for the drugs and diseases I see all the time.</p>

<pre><code>.ra = rheumatoid arthritis
.psa = psoriatic arthritis
.sle = systemic lupus erythematosus 
.ssc systemic sclerosis
.oa = osteoarthrosis 

.pred = prednisone
.mtx = methotrexate 
.lef = leflunomide (Arava) 
.hcq = hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)
.hum = adalimumab (Humira)
.enb = etanercept (Enbrel)
.rit = rituximab (Rituxan) 
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how for some of the drugs I’ve included the brand name. This aides in clarity for the patient or non-rheumatologists who may not be as familiar with the generic names of the drugs. e.g. Rheumatologists typically use hydroxychloroquine but most patients know it as Plaquenil. When a patient leaves the office with my note, I don’t want them calling later to leave a message that they aren’t on that medication with the long name like my note says.</p>

<p>I can also use it to help me remember how to spell the drugs names or even remember some of the generics myself.</p>

<pre><code>.ken = triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog)
</code></pre>

<p>Even some non-drug words are just impossible to remember to spell correctly.</p>

<pre><code>.eyemd = ophthalmology
</code></pre>

<p>Occasionally, there are some weird labs whose abbreviations are non-standard but whose names are too weird to spell out every time.</p>

<pre><code>.la = lupus anticoagulant 
.acl = anticardiolipin antibody
.b2g = beta 2 glycoprotein antibody
</code></pre>

<p>I also don’t like typing out my physical exam findings, but this can be important for other doctors and audits.</p>

<pre><code>.rom = range of motion
.nrom = normal range of motion
.prom = passive range of motion
.arom = active range of motion
.rhsj = red, hot and/or swollen joints 
</code></pre>

<p>Now we start to pick up the pace a bit. I am frequently recommending that patients exercise, but they are far more likely to follow my instructions if I give concrete examples instead of vague platitudes.</p>

<pre><code>.exercise = Exercise by walking 30 minutes every day after dinner. 
    			http://youtu.be/aUaInS6HIGo
</code></pre>

<p>Coders love when I include the diagnostic codes with my assessment, especially for the weird (redundant?) rheumatology stuff.</p>

<pre><code>.dxra = Rheumatoid arthritis (714.00)
.dxia = Inflammatory polyarthropathy, unspecified (714.9)
.dxhrd = High Risk Drug (v58.69)
.dxea = Enteropathic arthritis (713.1)
</code></pre>

<p>Not infrequently, I want to impart a bit of knowledge to both the patient and the referring doctor. For example, in the case of a patient referred for a positive ANA or positive rheumatoid factor, it’s one thing to say they don’t have lupus or rheumatoid arthritis but it’s even better to explain what that damn tests means.</p>

<pre><code>.posana
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>A positive ANA does not diagnose an autoimmune disease nor does a negative result exclude it; however, ANA is positive in 99% of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus therefore a negative result strongly argues against such a diagnosis.  ANA can be positive by definition in 5% of the healthy population, typically in titers less than 1:320.  Up to 20% of healthy relatives of patients with rheumatic disease and up to 75% of healthy individuals older than 70 will have a positive ANA (typically less than 1:80 with a speckled or homogenous pattern).  Other conditions associated with a positive ANA are thyroid disease, chronic infections including TB/viral hepatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, malignancies, any of the auto-immune or connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis and patients with silicone breast implants.  In the absence of physical or biochemical evidence of pathology, a positive ANA is not clinically useful. </p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>.posrf
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many conditions can lead to a positive Rheumatoid Factor including chronic hepatic and pulmonary diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren’s, polymyositis, sarcoid, malignancies (especially after therapy), AIDS, mononucleosis, parasitic infections, chronic viral infections, tuberculosis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, cryoglobulinemia, etc.  Frequency of positivity of rheumatoid factor in normal individuals also occurs and varies by age from 5% in those younger than 70 to 10-25% in those older than 70.  Changes in RF level do not reflect disease activity; however, a high titer does predict increased severity of disease including extra-articular manifestations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can even use this to remind me of recommendations on certain items. For example, I can never remember the exact recommendations from the BMJ on the duration of steroids for PMR.</p>

<pre><code>.bmjpmrsteroids

Daily prednisone 15 mg for 3 weeks
Then 12.5mg for 3 weeks
Then 10mg for 4–6 weeks
Then reduction by 1 mg every 4–8 weeks
</code></pre>

<p>Can’t remember the criteria for the diagnosis of Takayasu’s arteritis?</p>

<pre><code>.dxcTA
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Age at disease onset ≤40 years (Development of symptoms or findings related to Takayasu arteritis at age ≤ 40 years)    </li>
    <li>Claudication of extremities (Development and worsening of fatigue and discomfort in muscles of one or more extremity while in use, especially the upper extremities)</li>
    <li>Decreased brachial artery pulse (Decreased pulsation of one or both brachial arteries)</li>
    <li>BP difference &gt;10mmHg (Difference of &gt;10mmHg in systolic blood pressure between arms) </li>
    <li>Bruit over subclavian arteries or aorta (Bruit audible on auscultation over one or both subclavian arteries or abdominal aorta)</li>
    <li>Arteriogram abnormality (Arteriographic narrowing or occlusion of the entire aorta, its primary branches, or large arteries in the proximal upper or lower extremities, not due to arteriosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, or similar causes; changes usually focal or segmental)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>3 of 6 required for diagnosis with a yield to 91% sensitivity and 98% specificity.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arend WP, Michel BA, Bloch DA, et al. The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of Takayasu arteritis. Arthritis Rheum 1990;33:1129–1132</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You look like a gunner on your note while making sure you remember the diagnostic criteria.</p>

<p>Of course, you can’t forget your note templates.</p>

<pre><code>.arthronote
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rheumatology Procedure Note</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Procedure: Arthrocentesis
Date of Service: %B %e, %Y<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consent: Verbal consent obtained from patient.<br />
Time Out: Yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Procedural Medications:  1% lidocaine, *** cc; *** 40mg/1ml, *** mg; *** Gebauer’s Spray</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Description of Procedure: After consent was obtained, the *** was prepped with betadine and alcohol.  Gebauer’s spray and plain 1% lidocaine was used as local anesthetic. The joint was entered and *** ml’s of *** colored fluid was withdrawn and sent for ***.  Steroid and Lidocaine were then injected and the needle withdrawn.  The procedure was well tolerated and hemostasis was obtained.  The attending physician was present for the entire procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The patient was asked to continue to rest the joint for a few more days before resuming regular activities and warned that it may be more painful for the first 1-2 days.  He/she was instructed to watch for fever, or increased swelling or persistent pain in the joint. Call or return to clinic prn if such symptoms occur or there is failure to improve as anticipated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See those strange characters after “Date of Service”? This is special code in TextExpander that automatically inserts that day’s date when the note is created. TextExpander has a lot more codes like this and others than can really power your macros. More on that in part 2.</p>

<hr />

<p>Hopefully, by now, I’ve convinced you that you can save a lot of time and stress by turning your frequently used words, phrases and templates into easy to type macros. In future posts, I will delve into some more advanced, yet easy to pick up, topics including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Special codes in TextExpander</li>
  <li>Syncing your macros across computers</li>
  <li>Keys to building and remembering your macros</li>
  <li>TextExpander on your iPhone and iPad.</li>
  <li>Ideas for macros </li>
  <li>Non-medical uses for TextExpander</li>
</ol>

<p>I will also answer some potential objections to my method, such as why you might want a text macro program if your EMR comes with templates (CPRS) or has a macro functionality (Epic).</p>

<p>If you have any specific questions or concerns you’d like addressed in the future posts, let me know.</p>

<h3 id="the-fish">The Fish</h3>

<p>Safari has an option to “Merge All Windows”. On the menu bar go to Window &gt; Merge All Windows. Simple.</p>

<p>Even better, you can create a shortcut for this.</p>

<p>Open System Preferences (command-spacebar, type “System”), click on Keyboard, choose Keyboard Shortcuts, choose Application Shortcuts, click the “+” button. Under Application: choose Safari. Under Menu title: Type “Merge All Windows”. Under Keyboard Shortcut: press shift + option + command + m. Click add.</p>

<p>Now, whenever you have a bunch of Safari windows open, just hit shift + option + command + m. (It’s a lot easier than it sounds.)</p>

<h3 id="how-to-fish">How to fish</h3>

<p>I always end up with a million browser windows open, each with several open tabs in them. Frequently, they have the same mail, calendar, Google reader and log in to my EMR websites pulled up on them. Typically this happens when I click on a link in the first window and it opens the link in a new browser window, then later, with that window on top, I want my email and open a new tab to go to it, even though the same site is open in a different window that’s hidden. </p>

<p>I thought two things: windows should always open in a new tab and there should be a way to easily merge all these windows together. <em>I wish I could say that I immediately Google’d it and figured it out.</em> Unfortunately, I’ve been thinking about this for months and never bothered to do anything about it. This has happened to me more times than is healthy. I need to just learn that when I have a problem, there’s probable a solution already created.</p>

<p>For the first step, go to the menu bar: Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Tabs. Under “Open pages in tabs instead of windows:” choose automatically. For the second step, I explained the second part above.</p>

<p><strong>Moral</strong>: There is almost always an easy way to do something on a Mac. If you want to do something, Google for how to do it.</p>

<p>About a week ago my laptop became infected with a virus or two hundred when I visited a website.  I know this because google warned me it might contain malware and I went there anyway and as soon as I did my practically worthless virus program (Sophos) started screaming about infected files, but was unable to DO anything about it.  Meanwhile all sorts of pop ups, adware, and internet explorer toolbars started ravaging my system.</p>

<p>I installed a few other programs that were able to find and delete most of them, but the pop ups continued, more files continued to be infected, crashes became status quo and I wanted to smash the laptop with a hammer.  I had done everything I could to halt the damage, even trying system restore, which kept failing to restore, without success.  Finally today, on my day off, I reformatted the HD and reloaded everything.  Actually, I’m still reloading everything.</p>

<p>Thankfully, all my music was on my iPod, so I can port that back over (illegally?) and all of my pictures, documents etc. are also saved on usb drives.  I did lose some videos and am wasting hours redownloaded, installing and configuring my software.</p>

<p>Viruses suck.  Virus makers should die.  Windows sucks for being so vulnerable or popular.  You pick.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content"><p>A couple weeks ago I developed an abscess in the root of one of my top molars.  I had the whole swelling, tenderness and pain thing.  I felt like dying or ripping the thing out by the roots, either of which would have treated the problem.  Instead I wasted $50 seeing an “emergency dentist” who told me it was infected and needed to be drilled or removed.  Well, no shit sherlock.  I’m a fucking doctor–I know that.  Then he gave me heavy duty narcotic pain meds and an antibiotic, which isn’t exactly recommended by the dental societies.  </p>

<p>The key point is that it is very unlikely for the infection to go away without physically removing it via root canal or tooth removal and I have no money for either.  So, I’m trying to hold the bacteria at bay with antibiotics and asprin until my insurance at @ new job kicks in.  </p>

<p>Things had actually gotten better for awhile.  The swelling, pain, sensitivity and looseness subsided.  </p>

<p>And came back yesterday.  I think I’ll end up losing the tooth if I wait on this, but I have no money.  So while I see patients who never pay, I myself can’t get the medical care I need for lack of money.  Isn’t it ironic, don’t you think?</p>

<p>At least if I ever get accused of not understanding what it is like to be poor or to go without medical case, I can laugh like the devil by the pale moon light.</p>

<p>Actually, the phone is great.  I’ve had her about 5 months.

Using Opera’s browser (the built-in one sucks), I can browse my favorite sites and check (and reply) to my gmail.  The megapixel camera is good for taking printable portraits and still-lifes, but being camphone, don’t hope for anything in motion or wining any contests.  She can connect to your computer using USB or bluetooth and you can put (and use) almost any files on her that way, including mp3 and pdf.  This also means you can create your own ringtones without paying the companies their extortion fees.  She comes with bluetooth that is fully functional, except for A2DP.  You can even program her to type text messages as you talk to her: voice-to-text.  I use her for flickr, blogging and surfing the internet, especially during long, boring medical lectures.</p>

  <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2014/02/07/Using-Keyboard-Maestro-to-control-windows-on-dual-monitors.html">Using Keyboard Maestro to control windows on dual monitors</a></h2>


        <div class="content"><p>I just started using a second monitor at work<sup id="fnref:140207162201"><a href="#fn:140207162201" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. The problem was that every time I would plug my Macbook Air into the monitor via the Thunderbolt connection, the previously arranged window position was lost. I have a very simple arrangement: my text editor maximized on my laptop, and the EMR maximized on the external screen. </p>

<p><strong>Keyboard Maestro to the rescue.</strong></p>

<p><a href="/images/Keyboard_Maestro_Dual_Screens.png"><img src="/images/Keyboard_Maestro_Dual_Screens.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>The main actions just move the desired application window to the top left of the respective screens, <code>SCREEN(1,</code> for the laptop screen and <code>SCREEN(2,</code> for the external monitor. The <code>+22</code> for the downward direction moves the window down below the menu bar, which is 22 pixels tall. The <code>-22</code> for the window height subtracts the menu height from the total window height so you don’t lose the last 22 pixels below the screen. </p>

<p>The hardest part of this macro is figuring out that you can type these commands into the action. Normally the action looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/Move_and_resize_1.png"><img src="/images/Move_and_resize_1.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>It looks like you can only input numbers<sup id="fnref:140207163434"><a href="#fn:140207163434" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, but if you start typing, it will transform to this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/Move_and_resize_2.png"><img src="/images/Move_and_resize_2.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> From the Yahoo Keyboard Maestro user group, I found more information on picking which screen you’re giving instructions to. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Numbers: designates the screens from left to right. 1, 2, 3…</li>
  <li>Main and Secondary: main refers to whatever screen is currently being used by the active window/application</li>
  <li>Internal and External: the iMac/laptop display versus the external display</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use these various designations depending on your use case. For example, I was originally using numbers, but that meant I had to have two separate macros for making a window maximized, one for the main monitor and one for the external, but by changing the <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> to <code>main</code>, it will maximize the window that has the focus on that screen. They have slightly different meanings, but this allows different functionality. </p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:140207162201">
      <p>The EMR we use is so poorly arranged that a larger screen is needed to make up for the poor design. <a href="#fnref:140207162201" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

        <div class="content"><p>I get easily distracted. I can be working on task A, which reminds be to do task B, then get into task C, and end up working 3 hours on task C, then back to 2 hours on task B, and finally get back to task A many hours later. Most of the time this isn’t a problem, and makes me very productive. Not so much at work. Writing an epic blog post or researching the perfect way to make ginger chicken at work–not such a good idea.</p>

<p>So, I made a quick Keyboard Maestro macro to force productivity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While logged in, repeating every 1 minute during the hours of 8am-5:30pm Monday through Friday:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If my medical record app or my text editing app are not at the front, then:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Quit the front application</li>
    <li>Open my medical record app </li>

<p>I love my Time Capsule and see myself continuing to buy them.</p>

<p>The Time Capsule I have is a 1st generation that I bought when they first came out. Living in an area without an Apple store at the time<sup id="fnref:130824090739"><a href="#fn:130824090739" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, I ended up driving 3 hours to get one. It’s been with me ever since through many years and 3 interstate moves. </p>

<p>I, like Siracusa, have many redundant backups of my data. I have multiple local clone copies<sup id="fnref:130824091132"><a href="#fn:130824091132" class="footnote">4</a></sup> and I also offload the raw data by itself on to external drives. </p>

<p>Several weeks/months ago my internal SSD suddenly died completely. I hadn’t made a clone back up or manually offloaded the data since the morning. I’d been working all day and had many, irretrievable projects that were lost, except for the Time Capsule back up from 30 minutes before.</p>

<p>I sent in the SSD on warranty, and when I got it back a week later, I booted up the new drive with it connected to the Time Capsule. It asked if I wanted to restore from the Time Capsule. I said yes and went to bed. </p>

<p>When I woke up in the morning, my baby was back.<sup id="fnref:130824091835"><a href="#fn:130824091835" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The beauty of the Time Capsule is it’s <em>fire and forget</em> usability.</p>

<p>That earns some loyalty.<sup id="fnref:wifebackup"><a href="#fn:wifebackup" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
