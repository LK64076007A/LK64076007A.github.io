      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Time-Capsule-back-up-vs.-Siracusa">Time Capsule back up vs. Siracusa</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>On the last<sup id="fnref:130824090332"><a href="#fn:130824090332" class="footnote">1</a></sup> episode of ATP<sup id="fnref:130824090353"><a href="#fn:130824090353" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, Siracusa said that the Time Capsule had “a terrible reputation for reliability, and I still think Time Machine over the network is not great”.</p>

<p>I love my Time Capsule and see myself continuing to buy them.</p>

<p>The Time Capsule I have is a 1st generation that I bought when they first came out. Living in an area without an Apple store at the time<sup id="fnref:130824090739"><a href="#fn:130824090739" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, I ended up driving 3 hours to get one. It’s been with me ever since through many years and 3 interstate moves. </p>

<p>I, like Siracusa, have many redundant backups of my data. I have multiple local clone copies<sup id="fnref:130824091132"><a href="#fn:130824091132" class="footnote">4</a></sup> and I also offload the raw data by itself on to external drives. </p>

<p>Several weeks/months ago my internal SSD suddenly died completely. I hadn’t made a clone back up or manually offloaded the data since the morning. I’d been working all day and had many, irretrievable projects that were lost, except for the Time Capsule back up from 30 minutes before.</p>

<p>I sent in the SSD on warranty, and when I got it back a week later, I booted up the new drive with it connected to the Time Capsule. It asked if I wanted to restore from the Time Capsule. I said yes and went to bed. </p>

<p>When I woke up in the morning, my baby was back.<sup id="fnref:130824091835"><a href="#fn:130824091835" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The beauty of the Time Capsule is it’s <em>fire and forget</em> usability.</p>

<p>That earns some loyalty.<sup id="fnref:wifebackup"><a href="#fn:wifebackup" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>And Casey was right.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Editorial-workflow-switching-list-types">Editorial workflow - switching list types</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I’ve had Editorial for less than an hour and I’ve made my first workflow. </p>

<p>I create my hacks as I need them and shortly after I starting writing I needed to change an unordered list to an ordered list. </p>

<p>First, I picked the action that outputs the selected text from the document. I then did a regex search for <code>^(\s*)[-*] </code><sup id="fnref:130818233455"><a href="#fn:130818233455" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to find the beginning of each line starting with the preface for an unordered list and replace it with <code>$11. </code>. The input is then used to replace the selected text in the document.</p>

<p>This was a good start but I wanted to be able to easily switch back and forth. I put those three actions inside an <code>if</code> action so that it only fires if it finds that there is a line starting with <code>-</code>. I added a <code>stop</code> action inside the <code>if</code> action to end the workflow once the if statement runs. I then added another <code>if</code> action that is basically the same except looks for lines starting with <code>1. </code> and replaces them with <code>- </code>. </p>

<p>Finally, I added an action at the beginning of the workflow that extends the selected text to the beginning and end of the lines to make selecting text a bit easier. </p>

<p>You can download this workflow <a href="http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5530680926666752/dS2_NO1n8U8">here</a>.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/modified-Keyboard-Maestro-macro-for-MultiMarkdown-Footnotes">A modified Keyboard Maestro macro for MultiMarkdown Footnotes</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><strong>Update: This post is long out of date. Zettt and I worked together to come up with a better, faster way to do the same thing with Keyboard Maestro. Find his latest version of his Keyboard Maestro Markdown Library to see it in action.</strong></p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>If you write in (Multi)Markdown and have Keyboard Maestro, I recommend you check out Andreas’s (@<a href="https://twitter.com/Zettt">Zettt</a>) <a href="http://www.macosxscreencasts.com/general/keyboard-maestro-markdown-library/">Keyboard Maestro Markdown library</a>, which makes it easy to write in Markdown through various schemes such as easily wrapping selected text with various special characters<sup id="fnref:20130530190615"><a href="#fn:20130530190615" class="footnote">1</a></sup>; creating inline links, reference links, and image tags with fill-in templates; making ordered and unordered lists from selected lines of text; and several others. His videos clearly explain how to use them. He also chose a brilliant hotkey schema that makes it easy to remember all the options once you learn one or two.</p>

<p>He’s currently working on some updates with the release of KM6, but that got me thinking about a modification I wanted to make.</p>

<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>

<p>As it stands now, after placing the footnote, the cursor is left at the bottom of the document, rather than back in the text where the writing will continue.<sup id="fnref:20130530193065"><a href="#fn:20130530193065" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This slight break in workflow is an unfortunate drawback of creating footnotes<sup id="fnref:20130530191980"><a href="#fn:20130530191980" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Some text editors do have the ability to remember cursor position so that it can be returned it to the original position, but one of the reasons I use Keyboard Maestro for these tasks is so they will be editor agnostic since I’m constantly changing my editor.</p>

<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>

<p>Keyboard Maestro 6 added a cursor position token: <code>%|%</code>. Since the original macro involved two paste actions separated by moving the cursor, I was going to need to combine them into one paste action. Instead of using ⌘-↓ to move the cursor to the bottom of the text, I use ⇧-⌘-↓ to select all the text from the cursor position to the bottom of the document. I then cut (⌘-X) this to the clipboard. Finally, I paste a concatenation of the footnote tag, the cursor position token, the clipboard, and the footnote:</p>

<pre>[^%Variable%MMDFootnoteTag%]%|%%CurrentClipboard%

[^%Variable%MMDFootnoteTag%]: %Variable%MMDFootnoteText%</pre>

<p>The extra carriage return is because, in my experience, you need to have a blank line between footnotes, unlike reference links, to get them to display correctly. Fletcher Penney <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide">recommends this format</a> with regards to bibliography support in Multimarkdown.</p>

<p>The final macro looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/modified_KM_macro_footnote.jpg"><img src="/images/modified_KM_macro_footnote.jpg" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>If you’re paying close attention, you might notice that I also added a default value for the footnote tag, which is just the date and time in <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/datetime">ICU yyyyMMddHHSS format</a>.</p>

<p>I think this makes it much easier and natural to write Multimarkdown footnotes, which may turn out to be a bad thing since I’m suddenly adding them all over the place.<sup id="fnref:20130530201400"><a href="#fn:20130530201400" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

    <p>Just as in the senate testimony, Cook refocuses the questions clearly but politely stating that he disagrees with the assumptions underlying the question.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hosts grill Cook on the stock price. When he points out that this is not a new phenomena and gives a history lesson on the stock, he asks “Do you know what the price was then?” the host replies “We don’t own Apple stock”.</p>

    <p>How does owning Apple stock have anything to do with knowing the price? Are you not a journalist? We’re you not the one who brought up the stock price in the first place? Now we’re supposed to believe you don’t follow it at all? Unbelievable, literally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook: Apple’s focus is on making the best product.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hosts: undeservedly arrogant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook on Google Glass: Thinks it won’t have broad appeal but will be useful in certain vertical markets. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook is wearing Nike Fuelband on stage. Likes it. Seems to imply that items that do one job do well work well so far, but multipurpose ones don’t and this needs to be solved. “Ripe for exploration.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Winning has never been about making the most. That has never been the cornerstone of Apple.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hosts: not pleasant people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook doesn’t use articles in front of Apple’s products. E.g. “I use iPad”, rather than “I use the/an iPad.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook: We will be rolling out the future of iOS and OS X in two weeks at our developer conference. “Jony has been really key.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cook on taxes: Our return is 2 feet high. It’s too complicated. The tax code needs to be gutted and simplified, which is how Apple approaches everything. Our suggestions on how to do this might mean Apple plays more taxes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Tim comes across as polished, measured, thoughtful, and confident. I hadn’t seen him before except in the senate testimony and a few keynotes. Am impressed.</p>

<p>Hosts come across as slow, stubborn, and rude. Good hosts make a great show and interview. These hosts seemed to just get in the way and their little self-referential comments were annoying.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> On <a href="http://instaca.st/b/8f5">Amplified</a>, Myke Hurley called the hosts cringeworthy and said it’s a recurrent problem. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the three dogs attacked an 11-year-old boy riding the dirt bike he had gotten for Christmas, neighbor Benjamin Srigley jumped in to help. He retrieved his 9mm Ruger P-90 handgun from his house and fatally shot one the animals. A D.C. police officer shot and killed the other two.</p>

  <p>But the 39-year-old’s actions — deemed heroic by the boy’s relatives — quickly became complicated. Authorities say Srigley had <em>legally bought the handgun and two other firearms in Virginia</em>, but he had failed to register them in the District.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>Police confirmed that Srigley has no criminal record in the District or elsewhere.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Two-improvements-with-Keyboard-Maestro-6">Two improvements with Keyboard Maestro 6</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> and use it both daily for my workflow as well as occasionally for projects as they arise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Version 6.0</a> was released today and is a major upgrade over version 5. There are many improvements both major, minor, and cosmetic. It was well worth the $25 upgrade price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/">Macdrifter</a> has a nice write up and I’m sure that <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/keyboard-maestro-6-0-adds-syncing-browser-actions-device-triggers-and-more/">Macstories</a> will have a very detailed review within a few weeks.</p>

<p>Today I’m just going to share two small items made possible with the new version.</p>

<h2 id="shorter-macros-with-browser-text-tokens">Shorter macros with browser text tokens</h2>

<p>First, some types of macros are more easy to create and are smaller due to the <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/documentation/6/tokens.html">new web browser text tokens</a>. I had <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/Switching-the-current-viewed-webpage-between-Safari-and-Chrome">previously created a macro</a> that would take an URL that was currently open in Safari and open it in Chrome instead, and vice versa. </p>

<p>The macro in version 5 is fairly long:</p>

<p><a href="/images/switching_browsers_KM5.jpg"><img src="/images/switching_browsers_KM5.jpg" alt="Switching browsers in KM5 macro" /></a></p>

<p>The same macro in version 6 is much smaller:</p>

<p><a href="/images/switching_browsers_KM6.jpg"><img src="/images/switching_browsers_KM6.jpg" alt="Switching browsers in KM6 macro" /></a></p>

<p>This is all directly or indirectly because there is a text token for the current URL in both web browsers. This gets rid of the AppleScript for getting the URL. It also indirectly allows me to get rid of commands to open the opposite web browser as well as to wait for that browser to be open. In the version 5 macro, I had a command to switch to the new browser since that was necessary in order to enter the URL into the address bar. Since in my situation, I may not want to immediately switch over to the other browser, I was able to leave that off too.</p>

<h2 id="easy-creation-of-markdown-links-from-current-webpage">Easy creation of Markdown links from current webpage</h2>

<p>Seeing how easy it was to change the above macro, I decided to make a quick macro to make a Markdown link using the current Safari URL as the link URL and the current Safari window title as the link text. I also used the new text token <code>%|%</code> to place the cursor in position to quickly change the link text in case the window title isn’t appropriate.</p>

<p><a href="/images/MD_link_from_Safari_title_url.jpg"><img src="/images/MD_link_from_Safari_title_url.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I’m looking forward to upgrading my old macros and kicking the tires a bit more. I can’t wait for my next project so I have a chance to create something new.</p>
