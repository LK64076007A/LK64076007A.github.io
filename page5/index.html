      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/a-doctors-notes---abbreviated">A doctor's notes - abbreviated</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>We doctors spend most of our working life documenting our clinical encounters but too often suffer from poor chart systems leading to inaccurate or inaccessible notes. We also fail to maintain ownership over our work product leading to a loss of useful clinical and practice information and worse patient care.</p>

<p>As an open, universally used EMR data standard does not exist, created my own system that I’d like to share with you. It is based on a set of principles that I’ve adopted from other modern, technological principles.</p>

<h1 id="principles">Principles</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Data must be easily entered at the point of care.</li>
  <li>Data must remain in the possession of the physician.</li>
  <li>Data must be protected from becoming unreadable due to expired proprietary formatting.</li>
  <li>Data must be encrypted.</li>
  <li>Data must be rapidly accessible both locally and remotely.</li>
  <li>Data must be easily searchable from outside the files proper.</li>
  <li>Data must be easily displayed in a aesthetically pleasing format that can be changed in time.<sup id="fnref:1366329887-fn1"><a href="#fn:1366329887-fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="hardware">Hardware</h1>

<p>Buy an 11 inch Macbook Air and turn on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault">File Vault</a> (full disk encryption) in the system preferences. </p>

<h1 id="solution---software">Solution - Software</h1>

<p>Write your notes into a plain text editor, using a text macro application, and save them as plain text files into one folder.</p>

<h1 id="the-painful-part---putting-your-note-in-their-chart">The Painful Part - Putting <em>Your</em> note in <em>Their</em> chart</h1>

<p>Your note saved in your records needs to be placed in the clinic or hospital records that the patient is at. If they have an EMR, just copy and paste the note into their application. If it is a paper chart, print it out.</p>

<h1 id="security">Security</h1>

<p>Maintain physical security over your laptop. It must always be in your possession or locked up in a safe or office that no one else (including janitors) have access to. The easiest system it to just keep your computer on you always, or locked in a safe at home.</p>

<p>Make a strong password. At least 8 characters, capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and symptoms. Make it some kind of phrase that it easy to remember and type. E.g. <code>Caesar?:ettu,Brute</code><sup id="fnref:1366329887-fn2"><a href="#fn:1366329887-fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="backups">Backups</h1>

<p>Make <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/clone-backups-why-and-how">clone back ups</a> of your machine. Make multiple copies of your back ups. Encrypt them. Keep them locked up. You can even make a USB necklace with all the notes on them.<sup id="fnref:1366329887-fn3"><a href="#fn:1366329887-fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="search">Search</h1>

<p>Use <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2531">Spotlight</a> or the powerful search feature of <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> to rapidly search through all your notes when you need to find something like “all your patients with psoriatic arthritis on azathioprine” or “all the consults sent to me by Dr. so-and-so”.</p>

<h1 id="formatting">Formatting</h1>

<p>Formatting is really not necessary but if you want to print out pretty notes or add letterhead to your faxed PDFs, you can use the <a href="http://bywordapp.com/markdown/guide.html">Markdown format</a> when writing your notes and the <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked application</a> for creating pretty PDFs with custom CSS formatting.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>In the end, you have an accurate, fast, reliable, secure, and searchable record system. It’s relatively cheap with the only significant cost being the hardware. You can use it across multiple clinics and hospitals using different medical record systems while maintaining a single unified records system on all your patients. </p>

<h1 id="future">Future</h1>

<p>I hope we don’t have to wait long until we do have cross platform, open EMR records. Until then, I think this is the best solution for physicians who have a modicum of nerd power.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/a-doctors-notes">A doctor's notes</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>Physicians spend a large part of their day documenting what they do, primarily in the form of the clinic note, but also telephone notes, record reviews, and the legions of forms the government and insurance companies create.</p>

<p>Over my time as a fellow and a private practice physician, I’ve created what I consider a relatively elegant and easy system for moderately skilled tech-nerd physicians to create, store, retrieve and disseminate their documentation and I’d like to share a small part of it with you.</p>

<p>I didn’t mean this post to become as long as it had. I tried to keep it short by leaving out most of the specifics, potential pitfalls, and alternatives. I failed. So I’ve created a “too long: didn’t/don’t read” (TL;DR) version that is both interspersed throughout the text below or <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/a-doctors-notes-abbreviated">available as a separate post</a>.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Data is important. </p>

<p>Data fails when it is inaccurate or inaccessible.</p>

<p>Paper charts and modern EMRs excel at failing in both of these areas. </p>

<p>Physicians need a better way to manage their clinical notes than is afforded by the software tools they are issued and most clinics and hospitals. </p>

<h1 id="inaccurate">Inaccurate</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL: DR: Boilerplate templates and copy-and-paste (CAP) have resulted in voluminous, inaccurate notes. Poorly designed software that inhibits data entry encourages the use of these templates and copy-and-pasted inaccuracies. This also inhibits entering all the pertinent data so that data is lost due to lack of documentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The perils of modern EMR documentation are <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/04/us-electronic-medical-records-idUSBRE9030IJ20130104">well described in the literature</a>. Most of the inaccuracies are created because of a combination of pressure to document unnecessary data in conjunction with the power to easily create this unnecessary documentation by templates or copy-and-paste. </p>

<p>Daily, I see patients in consultation for very specific joint symptoms in which the prior notes have a well documented, template-created, ENT exam but no joint exam.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn1"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I saw one patient whose initial visit to his PCP was for a sore throat and the exam dutifully noted pharyngeal erythema and tonsilar exudate, as did every subsequent exam for the next 2 years. Either it was the longest lasting case of strep throat in the history of medicine or the data was inaccurate. </p>

<p>All physicians know that a detailed, page long list of negative symptoms is most likely to mean the ROS was never done rather than that it was done completely. </p>

<p>And yet, sadly, this data stands as canon in the indelible, idealized EMR.</p>

<p>When you can’t even look at your own notes from a year ago and trust in their accuracy, you’re lost. </p>

<p>Another part of the reason that the data is inaccurate is because of numerous barriers to data entry. In a finite amount of time, I will have to document less if I use a feather quill than if I use a ballpoint pen. The same is true with computers. If the software is poorly designed requiring multiple screens, menus, pop ups, check boxes, and radial dialogue boxes, then the data will be incomplete or less accurate because it could not be entered frictionlessly.</p>

<p>It seems clear to me that no one who has ever created the UI of an EMR has actually had to use it to document multiple encounters in a busy clinical practice. This may explain why those physicians who frequently praise their EMR are either academics whose residents are writing their notes, or have paid underlings entering most of the data.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn2"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="inaccessibility">Inaccessibility</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL:DR: Modern EMRs, paper charts, changing jobs, network outages, server crashes, and outdated/unsupported data formats all conspire to keep you from accessing the data you created and need to take care of your patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Physicians spend a large amount of their time documenting the clinical history and exam; the interpretation of the combined history, exam, labs, imaging, and pathology; and treatments (and most importantly) the response to treatments over time. This historical knowledge is priceless and yet too often is neglected.</p>

<p>As physicians spend so much time creating this record and since it is so important to providing the best possible care, you would think we would guard this record religiously and yet I would assume that most physicians have no ownership over their work product. It is a common theme in the internet nerd community that one should own their data so that if you decide to stop using a company or the company shuts down, you have not lost your data. How much more important are our clinic notes than some Instagram photos or blog posts about your latests cooking experiment? </p>

<p>Notes can be inaccessible to the physician who created them for many reasons but primarily due to no longer working at the facility where they created the not or just not having remote<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn3"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> access.</p>

<p>Notes are written in one practice but when the physician leaves he doesn’t take the notes with him. In the days of paper charts, this might have been an unfortunate necessity but in the digital age the entire record could fit on a thumb drive.</p>

<p>Notes are written in the hospital on rounds. The notes stay in the hospital chart, completely inaccessible to the individual physicians’s clinic EMR. </p>

<p>Not long ago a colleague left the state. I inherited many of his patients. I was completely unable to get records. He no longer had them as having left them with the clinic when he moved. The hospital owned clinic was shut down. The hospital medical records department had no idea where they might be and seemed insulted that I would even ask them the question as their mandate ended at the hospital doors. All that knowledge and work was lost.</p>

<p>Next, records can be inaccessible because they are locally stored but you are remote, or because they are remotely stored, “in the cloud” in today’s parlance, but the internet/server/power is down. Local data is fast, while remote data is slow. Remote data can be ubiquitous, while local data isn’t.</p>

<p>Finally, data can become inaccessible due to proprietary data formats. Again, it is well documented that many EMRs create lock-in with their proprietary data format. Even if you can someone get that data out, it is unlikely that the data will survive future advances in technology. Simply put, I cannot read documents I created with word processors from the early 1990s, where as I can still read hand written notes from the same time. Data needs to be in some kind of common, non-proprietary, future-proof format.</p>

<h1 id="solution-preamble">Solution preamble</h1>

<p>This is not a best practices solution.</p>

<p>This is not an ideal solution.</p>

<p>This is a practical, this-is-the-world-I’m-living-in solution. </p>

<p>It is based on principles that are unchanging but is created with tools that are constantly changing and therefore it adopts to the tools.</p>

<p>It is not a complete EMR. It is a note taking system that I use that is powerful, practical, and functional within the confines of the modern medical system. I certainly wish there was a feature complete, powerful, EMR that allowed me to own my data and accurately input my notes with the benefits of remote and local storage combined. There is not.</p>

<p>It is not likely to be useful as-is for most physicians, but those with a modicum of technical knowledge should be able to easily adapt it or it’s principles to their own system.</p>

  <p>TL:DR: Buy an 11 inch Macbook Air and turn on File Vault in the system preferences. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the software is probably the most important part of my system, everything starts with the hardware. Hospitals and large medical clinics typically buy cheap Dell computers running Windows. This inevitably leads to slow, uncustomizable, one-size-fits-no-one machines running outdated software, bogged down by bloatware and viruses.</p>

<p>My weapon of choice is a Macbook Air. Apple computers are considered more expensive, but comparing equivalent models, are equal or cheaper than a similarly powered machine from another company. SSD drives are ridiculously faster than the traditional HDD. The Macbook Air<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn6"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn6" class="footnote">5</a></sup> is light enough to be easily carried around a clinic or hospital and small enough to type with on your lap or throw on any counter, exam table, or chair. The size also means that I can easily take it with me anywhere resulting in physical security of my files, part of the HIPAA requirement. While $1000 may be expensive compared to cheap Windows laptops, it’s cheaper than any board test I ever took and for something I use 8-12 hours a day, seems like a bargain to me.</p>

<p>The operating system for a new Macbook Air is OS X 10.8 or “Mountain Lion”. This operating system has built-in full disk encryption. While benchmark tests will show that this slows down the speed of the machine (as the CPU has to decrypt and re-encrypt your data on the fly as you open and change files) in clinical practice you will never notice. Having all my files encrypted provides security to my patient’s data and has frequently shut down any complaints from CMIOs that I’m using my personal hardware in the clinic. This disk encryption is part of keeping your patient records safe and HIPAA compliant and most clinics and hospitals have yet to comply with this kind of security. When my last clinic decided to implement disk encryption on numerous Windows machines from Dell and HP running various OS’s and with standard HDDs it was a nightmare. Nurses were locked out of computers for days and a drastic decrease in speed was noted immediately. In OS X you just need to flip a switch.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn7"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn7" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>If you want, you can get an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse to use when not mobile. My colleague does this. My wife and I do not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL:DR: Write your notes into a plain text editor, using a text macro application, and save them as plain text files into one folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I have the hardware, the next question is what to use to create the note. </p>

<p>Short answer: Anything but the EMR.</p>

<p>Longer answer: EMRs seem almost deliberately designed to be impossible to create notes with easily. They also typically store the data in proprietary formats and the data is usually locked into the EMR. So don’t use it. Yes, in a sense this creates more work, but I argue you’ll save time in other ways and with the benefit of owning your data.</p>

<p>I advocate you write your notes in plain text. Plain text is praised by programmers and nerds of every walk of life from <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1161549/forget_fancy_formatting_why_plain_text_is_best.html">lawyers</a> to physicians because it is “open”, non-proprietary, future-proof, easily encryptable, easily compressible, and results in small file sizes.</p>

<p>Plain text can be written in any text editor. You can even write in word processors like Word or Pages, but I strongly recommend against it. All computers come with a text editor like TextEdit on the Mac and there are many different free and cheap text editors available. Byword, IA Writer, Multimarkdown Composer<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn8"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn8" class="footnote">7</a></sup>, TextWrangler, and Textmate are just a few that I own and use based on my whim and mood. The great thing about plain text is that it does not have any formatting that locks it into one application.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-fn9"><a href="#fn:1366312334-fn9" class="footnote">8</a></sup> So if you create a months worth of notes in Byword and then decide to start using IA Writer because of its cute blue cursor, you don’t have to change anything about your data.</p>

<p>Your text editor will present you with one big text field that you can type or dictate into. No modal boxes. No pull down menus. No changing from screen to screen just to document different parts of the HPI.</p>

<p>I save each clinic, phone, and hospital note as a separate text document in one large folder called “patient notes”<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn10"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn10" class="footnote">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Of course, a large empty sheet can be intimidating and also somewhat slow. You don’t want to have to type out your headers and other boilerplate every time. For example, you don’t want to type out the name and date yourself each time you create a note, do you? So you need a text macro program. I’ve written about these before and there are plenty of others who have as well. Anything you are going to type over and over should be automated<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn11"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn11" class="footnote">10</a></sup>. </p>

<p>I use <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> and you can read my <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/tag/textexpander">many posts</a> on it or search the web for other’s articles. Basically, get a text macro program and learn how to use it. Don’t create all your macros at once. Build them up slowly and organically over time as you need them. It will take awhile, but your speed and accuracy in documentation will be impressive. In time, you will go from macros that turn <code>.hum</code> into <code>adalimumab (Humira)</code> to macros that turn <code>.mtx1</code> into <code>Rx: start methotrexate 2.5mg, take 15mg (6 pills) every 7 days, #30, refill 1</code> and eventually into macros that turn <code>.ddxcie</code> into</p>

<pre><code>Differential diagnosis of chronic inflammatory effusion/monoarthritis

<p>Some EMRs<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn12"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn12" class="footnote">11</a></sup> have macro functionality built in but that is limited to the program and the confines/rules of the program. By using a separate application that functions on top of the underlying applications you can use the same macros anywhere. So, if I get an curbside consult email from a family physician asking about what they should be considering in a patient with a chronic inflammatory effusion of the right knee, I can actually type 7 characters and hit send.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn13"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn13" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<p>I have a friend who has created amazing macros for things like the NIH stroke scale and a complete neurological physical exam that not only allows him to quickly document those items, but also serves as a kind of checklist to remind him not to skip anything. </p>

<p>I use it for everything from commonly misspelled works, to entire paragraphs of patient education, to plans of care, to templated procedure notes, to macros that calculate and type the patient’s age when I type the patients date of birth into the note.</p>

<p>Other Examples: </p>

<ul>
  <li><code>.dxra</code> = Rheumatoid arthritis (714.0)  </li>
  <li><code>HepB/C</code> = hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody </li>
  <li><code>.posana</code> = A positive ANA does not diagnose an autoimmune disease nor does a negative result exclude it; however, ANA is positive in 99% of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus therefore a negative result strongly argues against such a diagnosis.  ANA can be positive by definition in 5% of the healthy population, typically in titers less than 1:320.  Up to 20% of healthy relatives of patients with rheumatic disease and up to 75% of healthy individuals older than 70 will have a positive ANA (typically less than 1:80 with a speckled or homogenous pattern).  Other conditions associated with a positive ANA are thyroid disease, chronic infections including TB/viral hepatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, malignancies, any of the auto-immune or connective tissue disease, multiple sclerosis and patients with silicone breast implants.  In the absence of physical or biochemical evidence of pathology, a positive ANA is not clinically useful. </li>
</ul>

<p>One type of macro I use constantly is one that changes any medicine abbreviations like LEF into the full generic <em>and</em> brand name: leflunomide (Arava). This creates an extra level of education and safety for other physicians who may not be as familiar with our specialities medicines and also for the patient, who may know their drug by it’s generic name “Avara” while I type LEF or leflunomide. I frequently give my patient’s their notes or at least the assessment and plan at the end of each visit so having this clarity built in without any extra work on my part is important.</p>

<h1 id="the-painful-part---putting-your-note-in-their-chart">The Painful Part - Putting <em>Your</em> note in <em>Their</em> chart</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL:DR: Your note saved in your records needs to be placed in the clinic or hospital records that the patient is at. If they have an EMR, just copy and paste the note into their application. If it is a paper chart, print it out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you have <em>your</em> note. Now what? This depends on the medical record system for your hospital or clinic, but with one commonality: it will be ugly, slow, inelegant, and painful. You have to put your note into the medical records of the clinic or hospital in which you’re seeing the patient. EMRs are not open and do not use common data formats even between the same EMR at different hospitals. Paper charts are still used widely in most hospitals in the country. There’s just no getting around this no matter what you do. If you want to keep your data and want to benefit from the legibility and speed of typed text on your own machine, you just have to put up with it.</p>

<p>At my last job the clinic had an EMR and the hospital used paper charts. It is likely that you have a similar situation. </p>

<h2 id="emr-charts">EMR Charts</h2>

<p>In my EMR and in whatever EMR you are likely to be using, you will need to copy and paste the text into the EMR. In EMR’s that have a large open text field like CPRS this is relatively easy. In complicated EMRs like NextGen, you’ll have to find a free text dialogue box and paste it in there before “generating” the note. There may be issues with poor line formatting but there are ways around this.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn14"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn14" class="footnote">13</a></sup> </p>

<p>Frankly, I have to force myself not to care about the formatting of my notes in the EMR because those who make them and those who buy them just don’t care and I would waste hours of my time trying to make them look good. I just copy-and-paste, close my eyes, and hit submit. I have to console myself that the note in my system and the note I send out to the physicians consulting me looks like I actually care.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn15"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn15" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="paper-charts">Paper Charts</h2>

<p>When at a clinic or hospital with a paper chart, I carry a small, retractable universal printer cord with me that I can plug it into the back of the networked printers at the nursing stations and just printing my note to place in the chart.</p>

<h1 id="solution---backup-and-security">Solution - Backup and Security</h1>

<p>These are your notes. These are your patient’s notes. They are gold and they are poison. You absolutely cannot afford to lose them to theft or to data lose both because of the loss of such valuable information and also due to potentially severe financial penalties from violating patient privacy laws. Your back ups and your security must be strong and usable (read: easy).</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>First, you must maintain physical security. This means the computer you use and any back ups you have must be physically protected. You don’t leave your computer unattended in your office. You don’t leave your back ups in your unlocked office on your desk. </p>

<p>My computer is on me 90% of the time during normal life, and when it is not, it is locked up. My backups are also either on my person or locked away in a hidden location. Use both physical security and security by obscurity. </p>

<p>Second, you must have a strong password to lock your machine. It should be easy to remember and easy to type but it also needs to be long <sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn16"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn16" class="footnote">15</a></sup> and not simple words. iloveyou, password, 1234567, qwerty, asdfjkl; and temporary are not secure passwords. Use 3-4 words you can easily remember but aren’t easily associated with you (kids and pets names are bad), substitute a few characters here and there, and that should be good enough in most cases. A good one might be something like <code>Caesar?:ettu,Brute</code><sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn17"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn17" class="footnote">16</a></sup>. </p>

<p>Third, your data should be encrypted. This can be really complicated and painful to do. But you bought a Macbook Air and turned on File Vault, right? Ok, moving on.</p>

<p>Finally, your remote data must also be transmitted and physically stored securely. If you’re using a public company then I would say to be safe you need to have a HIPAA (I think the fancy acronym for this is BAA.) agreement in place with them and they need to promise that they are following HIPAA compliant practices. Most services such as Dropbox, do not. ;-( </p>

<p>Thankfully, there is a new product (and more on the way) that provides remote, encrypted data in a Dropbox-style fashion for a reasonable price: <a href="http://filetransporter.com">Transporter</a>. You can plug their device into your own networks (that should be physically and electronically secured) and it creates a Dropbox-style folder on your machine giving you the power of Dropbox (both remote and local data synchronization) without the messy business agreements and monthly cost. <em>I have not implemented this into my workflow yet</em>, but will in the next two months. I plan on having one at my clinic and one at home providing cloud storage and back up while maintaining a local copy as well. </p>

<h2 id="backup">Backup</h2>

<p>There are many articles out there on the importance of backing up your data. Google them. Read them. Do them.</p>

<p>I make multiple <a href="/The-safety-of-clone-backups">clone back ups</a> of my computer which includes my patient notes. I keep one copy on me and I keep two other copies locked in fire proof safes. It’s really not that hard and it is your responsibility. </p>

<p>You can also set up a remote backup/storage using something like the <a href="http://filetransporter.com">Transporter</a> mentioned above.</p>

<p>Finally, text files are so small, you can even easily keep a copy of them on an encrypted USB drive you wear around your neck on a chain.<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn18"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn18" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Now that’s dedication.</p>

<p>Backup up my data is just a part of my day. I’d sooner leave my door unlocked then not backing up my files.</p>

<p>So that covers principles 1-5 that I [enumerated above][Principles], leaving only search and formatting. </p>

<h1 id="solution---search">Solution - Search</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use Spotlight or the powerful search functions in applications like TextWrangler to search quickly and easily in all your notes at once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google redefined the power of search in our minds, first with ability to easily search the entire internet and then the ability to search your mail, your desktop, and all your files. Rather than having to store files/emails in complicated, sub-nested folders, you just type a few words that you expect to find in the file/email and instantly see all the matching results.</p>

<p>Mac’s<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn20"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn20" class="footnote">18</a></sup> have full, in-file text search built into the operating system. It’s called Spotlight and you can bring it up easily by hitting ⌘-spacebar or clicking on the magnifying class icon in the upper right of your screen. This is the fastest way to search your files. If you need a bit more power and fine-tuning use Spotlight the Finder (option-command-spacebar).</p>

<p>Just today a colleague asked me how many patients with psoriatic arthritis I have that are on azathioprine (Imuran). I didn’t think I had any, but I checked and by typing the following characters and nothing else, I brought up the 4 notes on one patient in which I did: <code>⌘-spacebar .psa .aza</code>.</p>

<p>Although I’m told that this is possible in some EMRs such as ***, it was not possible on the EMRs I’ve used in the past including NextGen, Epic, CPRS, and IPR.</p>

<p>Another example of this power is when another specialist approached me recently to ask about a patient he sent me. He couldn’t remember their name and actually thought I probably hadn’t seen the patient yet. By searching for consults ordered by this physician, I was able to pull up the consult note before he’d even finished speaking, and tell him my findings.</p>

<p>And I use this search functionally all the time. Whenever my nurse mentions a patient to me, my reflexes kick in and I quickly have their last clinic note open, and a new note created and ready for me to document whatever we’re about to talk about. </p>

<p>It is about uniquitous access to information and easy, rapid creating of new data. I’ve never read GTD, but I wouldn’t be afraid to show my system to David Allen.</p>

<h1 id="formatting">Formatting</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL:DR: Adding formatting takes some more work and nerdery that you may want. If so, just write in plain text—it’s fine. If you do want to be fancy then learn <a href="">Markdown</a> and <a href="">CSS</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By it’s very nature and what makes it useful for this kind of system, plain text does not have any formatting but there there are times when you may want some formatting. This is why many people when they write papers will use something like Word so they can add strange fonts, weird colors, or pictures. I was tempted to the dark side at one point because I wanted to have my letterhead in the header of the document. This is easiest with a word processor program but can still be accomplished with some nerdery.</p>

<p>I write my notes in a style called Markdown. Markdown allows you to write in plain text but add some extra characters that allow the plain text to be converted to a formatted style like HTML, while still maintaining readability in the plain text.</p>

<p>Confused? Me too at first, so here’s an example.</p>

<p>If I want to <strong>bold</strong> something, I just put two asterisks on either side of the words  **like this**. When you read it in plain text it “looks” bold or emphasized, right? Markdown also includes formatting for <em>_italics_</em>, headers, numbered lists, bullet lists, and links.</p>

<p>I then use an application called <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a> which will take my text notes and display/save/print them with the Markdown formatting as well as with any other formatting I’ve created as a template using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>. When I’m going to print a copy of my note for the patient or the referring physician, or when I’m going to archive it as a PDF<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn21"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn21" class="footnote">19</a></sup> I run it through Marked to get the final document. </p>

<p>This allows me to take a note that looks like what is on the left and print a note that looks like what you see on the right.</p>

<p><a href="/images/noteandMarkedpreview.png"><img src="/images/noteandMarkedpreview.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>When I change clinics (new letterhead) or change moods (different font) or get older (bigger font), I can just change one CSS file rather than having to change every old note.</p>

<p><a href="/images/CSSnoteexamples.png"><img src="/images/CSSnoteexamples.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>This last step is a bit more complicated and requires more educational investment that most will want to do. It’s ok. You can still make great looking notes just using plain text formatting either with or without Markdown. Other possibilities are to use ALL CAPS for your headers, or to just print your notes out on a printer that is loaded with your office’s letterhead. </p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>What I have is an accurate, fast, reliable, secure, and searchable record system for every patient I’ve ever seen. The cost of the hardware is significant, but relatively not that expensive<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn22"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn22" class="footnote">20</a></sup> and something I would buy anyway even if I wasn’t a physician. The cost of the software can range from free to less than 100 USD. The skills necessary to use this system seem minimal to me, but being a tech nerd, I recognized that my opinion may be heavily biased. You will likely need to be able to type fast or have good dictation software. You will need to be comfortable around computers, which for our eminent members is likely not a given, but will certainly be standard for our new initiates. The more “advanced” features like Markdown and CSS, really aren’t that difficult compared to memorizing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citric_acid_cycle">Kreb cycle</a> or knowing when to appropriately order an <a href="http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-college-of-rheumatology/">ANA</a>.</p>

<h1 id="future">Future</h1>

<p>I didn’t create this system because I think I’m the smartest guy out there. I created it because I needed something that worked and everything I’ve used since I started my medical education<sup id="fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn23"><a href="#fn:1366312334-1366312334-fn23" class="footnote">21</a></sup> has been truly atrocious to the point that even <a href="http://vimeo.com/31926572">John Gruber took notice</a>.</p>

<p>I truly hope that someday a system is created that works wonderfully and follows the principles I’ve listed above. At a minimum, I hope that a system is created that is so wonderful and powerful that I am willing to compromise on those principles in order to use it as it will mean a vast improvement in the care of patients and in the work burden of all physicians.</p>

      <p>Different operating systems use different invisible characters to represent a line break. Typically Mac, Windows, and Unix all use a different set of characters so if the system you’re copying from is different than the system you’re pasting into, as is the case with many EMRs that are running remotely through a VPN, you will get weird line breaks, or no line breaks at all. This can be easily fixed by either changing the character for the line break when pasting using an application like Keyboard Maestro (this is what my neurology friend does), or some Text Editors like IA Writer let you choose your line break character when saving the file as in the image below. <a href="/images/linebreaksIAwriter.png"><img src="/images/linebreaksIAwriter.png" alt="" /></a>  <a href="#fnref:1366312334-1366312334-fn14" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Creating-a-plain-text-wiki-with-nvALT">Creating a plain text wiki with nvALT</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When I was in medical school, they issued the student’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLIÉ">Sony Cliés</a>.<sup id="fnref:1365609755-Model"><a href="#fn:1365609755-Model" class="footnote">1</a></sup> It was an awesome little device for the time and I took a lot of notes on it while on rounds. Sadly, a few years later, I was unable to read the files when the Clié finally died and I was unable to read the files with any of the software on my computers.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been an advocate for plain text file. Plain text does not use any strange or proprietary formatting so the files can be read on any platform and in any app. The data is about as future-proof as you can get.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1161549/forget_fancy_formatting_why_plain_text_is_best.html">many other benefits to plain text as well</a>.</p>

<p>Although I use many apps on many devices to read my plain text files, my favorite by far is <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2012/02/28/nvalt-2-2-public-beta/">nvALT</a>. It is fast, responsive, intuitive, and created by <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/about/">a programmer I highly respect</a>. Unfortunately, it is free, but you can donate money like I did to support its continued development. </p>

<p>Today I found another useful way to use nvALT.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-plain-text-wiki">Creating a plain text wiki</h2>

<p>As I was reading an article on auto-inflammatory syndromes, I was struck with the idea of creating a list of all the rheumatology diseases. I hit my hotkey trigger to bring up nvALT and typed “rheumatology diseases” to see if I might have started such a list before. No results appeared, so I hit enter and the document with the title “rheumatology diseases” was created.</p>

<p>I copy and pasted the list of auto-inflammatory diseases into the note and went back to reading the article. As is typical, the article started with the first disease and moved down the list. <em>Now I wanted another text document about that disease in which I could write some notes</em>. While it wouldn’t be hard to do, wouldn’t it be nice if the original list of diseases could link to this other document so I could easily browse them in the future?</p>

<p>It happens that nvALT has an in-app feature<sup id="fnref:1365609755-fn1"><a href="#fn:1365609755-fn1" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that allows you to create links to other documents by wrapping the words in [[double brackets]]. Whatever words are in double brackets link to a note with the same words as the title. Example: “I love to eat [[chocolate]].” would link to a document with the name chocolate.txt. In my case, “FMF - [[familial Mediterranean fever]]” linked to a new document “familial Mediterranean fever.txt”.</p>

<p>As I read my way through the journal article, I created a new text document for each disease that is linked to from the disease list document. I imagine in this way, I could accidentally end up writing a book someday, or maybe just a good wiki for my website. Since I’m writing it all in Markdown anyway, the conversion would be relatively simple.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s simple. It’s elegant.</p>

    <li id="fn:1365609755-fn1">
      <p>This means it works in the app, but won’t work elsewhere. Because the documents are plain text, this won’t break the document when read in other applications, but the link itself won’t be active. <a href="#fnref:1365609755-fn1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/morning-sickness-pill-again">The first US morning sickness pill, again</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>My dad told me a story as a kid about a good medicine that used to exist for morning sickness until some greedy nurse had a baby with birth defects and sued the company. They lost and the drug wasn’t profitable enough for them to continue making it in the face of potential future lawsuits and the precedence of that loss. They stopped making the drug. Sometimes, my dad would have the drug (really just a couple of over-the-counter pills) made up specially for certain patients. </p>

<p>At least that’s how I remember the story. </p>

<p>From this I learned several lessons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The legal system is not about justice. </li>
  <li>The people closest to the medical system are the ones who abuse it the most. </li>
  <li>Sometimes you have to take great risks to do the right thing. </li>
  <li>The good guy doesn’t always win. </li>
</ol>

<p>Looks like the drug is coming back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>U.S. doctors have had no officially approved treatment for morning sickness since lawsuits forced Bendectin off the market in 1983. But the drug’s main ingredients are vitamin B6 and an over-the-counter antihistamine, and obstetricians often advised pregnant women how to mix up the right dose themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2013-04-08/fda-approves-return-of-drug-for-morning-sickness">Businessweek</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>U.S. health regulators have approved a drug to treat morning sickness that was withdrawn from the market 30 years ago amid claims, since debunked, that it caused birth defects.</p>

      <div class="content"><p><a href="http://www.agraphia.net/the-patient-satisfaction-dilemma/">Zac at Agraphia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a click of a button I can easily do all these things, even when I know I shouldn’t.  And I’ll get paid more.  And I’ll avoid lawsuits.  And my patient interactions will be far more pleasant.  I suppose in the end, I try to do the right thing instead of the easy thing because I firmly believe that my duty is to take care of my patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no way around the fact that there will always be some amount of paternalism in medicine because there will always be a significant knowledge gap between the physician and the patient. </p>

<p>When “satisfaction” is taken to the extreme as a marker of quality and when “making the customer happy” becomes the primary rule in a clinic, good physicians will suffer great psychological pressure and patients will be at risk. </p>

<p>I think the ER is the place where we will see the worst consequences of this mandate. </p>

<p>Today they launched version 6 of their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen-6/id609301478?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen-6/id609301478?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro</a> application for the Mac. </p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpenpro-6/id609313570?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro is $40</a></p>

<p>PDFpen Pro is a powerful PDF editor. It has the simple editing functions typical of what you would expect even on an iOS app: highlighting, notes, commenting, shapes, stamps, signatures, deskewing, resampling, cropping, etc..</p>

<p>The real power comes from its other editing abilities.</p>

<h2 id="redacting-information">Redacting Information</h2>

<p>You can redact text either by deleting it and replacing it with a black bar, a la spy movies, or delete it completely and leave it blank. </p>

<p>Example: The ACR has an excellent handout on a certain disease but one line is outdated. Rather than re-creating the whole PDF, just remove the one outdated line. </p>

<p>Example: Need to send your tax return to some company, but don’t want your social security exposed? You can do a search and replace redaction through the entire document in just a few seconds.</p>

<h2 id="make-non-fillable-pdfs-fillable">Make Non-Fillable PDFs Fillable</h2>

<p>It seems to be a bad habit in medical administration to use a scanned copy of an old paper document for application forms rather than creating fresh, fillable PDFs. We both know that we will never change the archaic practices of established medical organizations like state medical boards, but that doesn’t mean we have to be slaves to them. </p>

<p>Rather than suffering this indignity, open the PDF with PDFpen Pro and choose <code>Edit &gt; Create Form Fields</code>. PDFpen Pro will go through and find all the places that should be fillable and create them. Now you can complete the PDF as easily as is possible and email it back. </p>

<p>Here’s an example I did with my own consult order form:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/MTMG%20consult%20order%20form.pdf">Here is the PDF that was made by exporting from Pages</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/MTMG%20consult%20order%20form%20fillable2.pdf">And here the same PDF after using the PDFpen Pro</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly the second option is more professional and easier for the user to complete.</p>

<p>If you happen to be one of those “established medical organizations” I mentioned, then you can make your own forms fillable now and save your customers time and yourself the hassle of trying to read doctor handwriting.</p>

<p><strong>I also used this in my clinic to turn the radiology departments order form into a fillable PDF that automatically inserted the correct days date, my signature, and a pick menu of the common reasons I order imagine studies with the associated ICD-9 codes.</strong></p>

<h2 id="create-pdf-forms">Create PDF Forms</h2>

<p>Especially if you are a professional (individual or organization), the forms you host on the internet should be clean, fresh PDFs that are fillable, rather than blurry, tilted, off-center scans of old word documents. PDFpen Pro has complete features to create fillable PDFs including check boxes, radio buttons, drop-down pick lists, and fillable text boxes. You can create new PDFs from scratch in PDFpen Pro, or import PDFs created in other applications like Word or Pages and add the fillable areas. </p>

<h2 id="turn-pdfs-into-word-documents">Turn PDFs Into Word Documents</h2>

<p>An interesting new feature of PDFpen Pro version 6 is the ability to take a PDF document and turn it into an editable Word document. I’m not sure if this is a feature I’d use myself since I can already edit PDFs with PDFpen Pro and I don’t use Word, but other professionals have told me that this is something they’re really excited about.</p>

<p>David Sparks, lawyer, has an <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2013/3/pdfpen-version-6">excellent blog post with an 8 minute video</a> including an example of this. </p>

<h2 id="watermarking">Watermarking</h2>

<p>Want to send out a PDF to others but either make sure that your intellectually property is marked, or that it’s clearly labeled as a <code>draft</code>? PDFpen Pro can easily watermark every page of a document so that your message is clear.</p>

<h2 id="ocr">OCR</h2>

<p>In addition, I also use PDFpen Pro to OCR documents for me. OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition and is the process by which computers take a flat image and find the words inside that image. For example, you are probably aware that when you type a document you can search inside that document for a specific word, but if you have a picture in that document and there happens to be a word in the picture it will not find the word. When you scan a document or take a picture of the document, the words themselves are not recognized. To make the words machine readable, you need to use OCR.</p>

<p>PDFpen Pro has a fast and accurate OCR. When I scan bills, contracts, patient records, and any other documents, I always make sure to OCR them so I can later search within the document. If I take a photo of a document with my iPhone, it uploads to a Dropbox folder and PDFpen Pro OCRs the document so it’s searchable later. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You have 100 pages of outside records on a patient. You want to know if they have previously been on azathioprine. If your document was scanned without being OCR’d, which has been the case in every clinic and hospital I’ve worked at, then you have to flip through every page manually looking for the word. On the other hand, if you OCR’d the document, then you can just search for <code>azathioprine</code>.</p>

<p>You can open a document in PDFpen Pro and have it OCR the document for you. Better yet, you can get really nerdy and use scripts written by others to watch for any new PDFs added to a specific folder (for example, your <code>patient records</code> folder) and automatically OCR them without bothering you.</p>

<p>I also use this technique whenever I’m on a webpage with image text that I want to save and manipulate. I take a screenshot that is automatically saved to the desktop, I add “OCR” to the file name, and PDFpen Pro sees that (via a Hazel task) and automatically OCRs it for me.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>PDFpen and PDFpen Pro can be bought either on the Mac App Store or directly from Smile. The MAS version includes iCloud syncing, which is not available with the direct purchase option.</p>

<p><strong>The MAS versions are on sale today and tomorrow only.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Convert websites to multi-page PDFs, complete with hyperlinks</li>
  <li>Create and edit cross-platform fillable PDF forms</li>
  <li>Create and edit document Table of Contents</li>
  <li>Create form fields automatically in a non-interactive form</li>
  <li>Edit document permissions to restrict saving, printing, copying, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This compares with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro.html">Adobe Acrobat XI Standard for $139</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro.html">Adobe Acrobat XI Pro for $199</a>.</p>

<p>I own the Pro version from the MAS.</p>

<p>So, now you know and if I see you putting non-fillable, scanned PDFs on your website, doctor, I will make fun of you. </p>

<p>This was quickly followed by “+1”s. </p>

<p>I have to agree that this echoes my sentiments too. I love KM as excellent software, but the extra work on answering (sometimes silly or rude questions) is really wonderful. </p>

<p>Even better was Peter’s deferential reply:</p>

  <p>It’s easy to say how I do it - I’m supported by all of you. I get to do what I love, work from home so I can walk my kids to school, make something that is useful to lots of people, and all because you folks all support me, both financially and by helping expand Keyboard Maestro to others.</p>
