      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Editorial-workflow-switching-list-types">Editorial workflow - switching list types</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I’ve had Editorial for less than an hour and I’ve made my first workflow. </p>

<p>I create my hacks as I need them and shortly after I starting writing I needed to change an unordered list to an ordered list. </p>

<p>First, I picked the action that outputs the selected text from the document. I then did a regex search for <code>^(\s*)[-*] </code><sup id="fnref:130818233455"><a href="#fn:130818233455" class="footnote">1</a></sup> to find the beginning of each line starting with the preface for an unordered list and replace it with <code>$11. </code>. The input is then used to replace the selected text in the document.</p>

<p>This was a good start but I wanted to be able to easily switch back and forth. I put those three actions inside an <code>if</code> action so that it only fires if it finds that there is a line starting with <code>-</code>. I added a <code>stop</code> action inside the <code>if</code> action to end the workflow once the if statement runs. I then added another <code>if</code> action that is basically the same except looks for lines starting with <code>1. </code> and replaces them with <code>- </code>. </p>

<p>Finally, I added an action at the beginning of the workflow that extends the selected text to the beginning and end of the lines to make selecting text a bit easier. </p>

<p>You can download this workflow <a href="http://editorial-app.appspot.com/workflow/5530680926666752/dS2_NO1n8U8">here</a>.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/modified-Keyboard-Maestro-macro-for-MultiMarkdown-Footnotes">A modified Keyboard Maestro macro for MultiMarkdown Footnotes</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><strong>Update: This post is long out of date. Zettt and I worked together to come up with a better, faster way to do the same thing with Keyboard Maestro. Find his latest version of his Keyboard Maestro Markdown Library to see it in action.</strong></p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>If you write in (Multi)Markdown and have Keyboard Maestro, I recommend you check out Andreas’s (@<a href="https://twitter.com/Zettt">Zettt</a>) <a href="http://www.macosxscreencasts.com/general/keyboard-maestro-markdown-library/">Keyboard Maestro Markdown library</a>, which makes it easy to write in Markdown through various schemes such as easily wrapping selected text with various special characters<sup id="fnref:20130530190615"><a href="#fn:20130530190615" class="footnote">1</a></sup>; creating inline links, reference links, and image tags with fill-in templates; making ordered and unordered lists from selected lines of text; and several others. His videos clearly explain how to use them. He also chose a brilliant hotkey schema that makes it easy to remember all the options once you learn one or two.</p>

<p>He’s currently working on some updates with the release of KM6, but that got me thinking about a modification I wanted to make.</p>

<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>

<p>As it stands now, after placing the footnote, the cursor is left at the bottom of the document, rather than back in the text where the writing will continue.<sup id="fnref:20130530193065"><a href="#fn:20130530193065" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This slight break in workflow is an unfortunate drawback of creating footnotes<sup id="fnref:20130530191980"><a href="#fn:20130530191980" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Some text editors do have the ability to remember cursor position so that it can be returned it to the original position, but one of the reasons I use Keyboard Maestro for these tasks is so they will be editor agnostic since I’m constantly changing my editor.</p>

<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>

<p>Keyboard Maestro 6 added a cursor position token: <code>%|%</code>. Since the original macro involved two paste actions separated by moving the cursor, I was going to need to combine them into one paste action. Instead of using ⌘-↓ to move the cursor to the bottom of the text, I use ⇧-⌘-↓ to select all the text from the cursor position to the bottom of the document. I then cut (⌘-X) this to the clipboard. Finally, I paste a concatenation of the footnote tag, the cursor position token, the clipboard, and the footnote:</p>

<pre>[^%Variable%MMDFootnoteTag%]%|%%CurrentClipboard%

[^%Variable%MMDFootnoteTag%]: %Variable%MMDFootnoteText%</pre>

<p>The extra carriage return is because, in my experience, you need to have a blank line between footnotes, unlike reference links, to get them to display correctly. Fletcher Penney <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown/wiki/MultiMarkdown-Syntax-Guide">recommends this format</a> with regards to bibliography support in Multimarkdown.</p>

<p>The final macro looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="/images/modified_KM_macro_footnote.jpg"><img src="/images/modified_KM_macro_footnote.jpg" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>If you’re paying close attention, you might notice that I also added a default value for the footnote tag, which is just the date and time in <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/datetime">ICU yyyyMMddHHSS format</a>.</p>

<p>I think this makes it much easier and natural to write Multimarkdown footnotes, which may turn out to be a bad thing since I’m suddenly adding them all over the place.<sup id="fnref:20130530201400"><a href="#fn:20130530201400" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>You can download the macro <a href="/images/Multimarkdown_Footnote.kmmacros">here</a>.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>I shop for groceries at Harris Teeter<sup id="fnref:20130530160464"><a href="#fn:20130530160464" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. If you use their loyalty card, the prices are much cheaper.<sup id="fnref:20130530160545"><a href="#fn:20130530160545" class="footnote">2</a></sup> I don’t like to carry a loyalty card on me, either in my wallet or on my keychain.<sup id="fnref:20130530160716"><a href="#fn:20130530160716" class="footnote">3</a></sup> I used to leave the loyalty card in my car, but then I’d forget to bring it into the store with me.<sup id="fnref:20130530160833"><a href="#fn:20130530160833" class="footnote">4</a></sup> They have an <a href=". https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ht-mobile/id422306980?mt=8&amp;at=11l4RT">iPhone app</a><sup id="fnref:20130530160955"><a href="#fn:20130530160955" class="footnote">5</a></sup> that includes a scannable loyalty card, but it’s slow and poorly designed. I would have to remember to open it up while I was on the last aisle in order to give it enough time to load and, it seemed, download the card from a server somewhere. This was unacceptably slow. So my work around was to take a screen shot of the loyalty card and just display that. It worked better, but was still not elegant.</p>

<p>So with help and prompting from <a href="https://twitter.com/waynehartman">some guy I met on the internet</a><sup id="fnref:20130530161214"><a href="#fn:20130530161214" class="footnote">6</a></sup>, I made a location-based Passbook card that pulls up the loyalty card’s barcode whenever I’m at the store.</p>

<p>I used the website <a href="https://api.passdock.com/users/sign_up/">Passdock</a> to create the card using one of their templates. I wasn’t able to create the barcode programmatically because Harris Teeter doesn’t use one of the approved barcode styles for Passbook. Instead, I trimmed out the barcode from the screenshot I had taken and put that in the place of the logo. I used the built in DigitalColor Meter app in OS X to make the colors match and put in the GPS coordinates to make sure it would appear whenever I was at the store. It took a little debugging at first, but it works perfectly.</p>

<p>Now, rather than being annoyed whenever I’m checking out, I get a little flush of satisfaction.</p>

    <p>Cook is wearing Nike Fuelband on stage. Likes it. Seems to imply that items that do one job do well work well so far, but multipurpose ones don’t and this needs to be solved. “Ripe for exploration.”</p>

    <p>Cook doesn’t use articles in front of Apple’s products. E.g. “I use iPad”, rather than “I use the/an iPad.”</p>

    <p>Cook on taxes: Our return is 2 feet high. It’s too complicated. The tax code needs to be gutted and simplified, which is how Apple approaches everything. Our suggestions on how to do this might mean Apple plays more taxes.</p>

<p>Tim comes across as polished, measured, thoughtful, and confident. I hadn’t seen him before except in the senate testimony and a few keynotes. Am impressed.</p>

<p>Hosts come across as slow, stubborn, and rude. Good hosts make a great show and interview. These hosts seemed to just get in the way and their little self-referential comments were annoying.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> On <a href="http://instaca.st/b/8f5">Amplified</a>, Myke Hurley called the hosts cringeworthy and said it’s a recurrent problem. </p>

  <p>When the three dogs attacked an 11-year-old boy riding the dirt bike he had gotten for Christmas, neighbor Benjamin Srigley jumped in to help. He retrieved his 9mm Ruger P-90 handgun from his house and fatally shot one the animals. A D.C. police officer shot and killed the other two.</p>

  <p>But the 39-year-old’s actions — deemed heroic by the boy’s relatives — quickly became complicated. Authorities say Srigley had <em>legally bought the handgun and two other firearms in Virginia</em>, but he had failed to register them in the District.</p>

  <p>Police confirmed that Srigley has no criminal record in the District or elsewhere.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Two-improvements-with-Keyboard-Maestro-6">Two improvements with Keyboard Maestro 6</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> and use it both daily for my workflow as well as occasionally for projects as they arise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Version 6.0</a> was released today and is a major upgrade over version 5. There are many improvements both major, minor, and cosmetic. It was well worth the $25 upgrade price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/">Macdrifter</a> has a nice write up and I’m sure that <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/keyboard-maestro-6-0-adds-syncing-browser-actions-device-triggers-and-more/">Macstories</a> will have a very detailed review within a few weeks.</p>

<p>Today I’m just going to share two small items made possible with the new version.</p>

<h2 id="shorter-macros-with-browser-text-tokens">Shorter macros with browser text tokens</h2>

<p>First, some types of macros are more easy to create and are smaller due to the <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/documentation/6/tokens.html">new web browser text tokens</a>. I had <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/Switching-the-current-viewed-webpage-between-Safari-and-Chrome">previously created a macro</a> that would take an URL that was currently open in Safari and open it in Chrome instead, and vice versa. </p>

<p>The macro in version 5 is fairly long:</p>

<p><a href="/images/switching_browsers_KM5.jpg"><img src="/images/switching_browsers_KM5.jpg" alt="Switching browsers in KM5 macro" /></a></p>

<p>The same macro in version 6 is much smaller:</p>

<p><a href="/images/switching_browsers_KM6.jpg"><img src="/images/switching_browsers_KM6.jpg" alt="Switching browsers in KM6 macro" /></a></p>

<p>This is all directly or indirectly because there is a text token for the current URL in both web browsers. This gets rid of the AppleScript for getting the URL. It also indirectly allows me to get rid of commands to open the opposite web browser as well as to wait for that browser to be open. In the version 5 macro, I had a command to switch to the new browser since that was necessary in order to enter the URL into the address bar. Since in my situation, I may not want to immediately switch over to the other browser, I was able to leave that off too.</p>

<h2 id="easy-creation-of-markdown-links-from-current-webpage">Easy creation of Markdown links from current webpage</h2>

<p>Seeing how easy it was to change the above macro, I decided to make a quick macro to make a Markdown link using the current Safari URL as the link URL and the current Safari window title as the link text. I also used the new text token <code>%|%</code> to place the cursor in position to quickly change the link text in case the window title isn’t appropriate.</p>

<p><a href="/images/MD_link_from_Safari_title_url.jpg"><img src="/images/MD_link_from_Safari_title_url.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I’m looking forward to upgrading my old macros and kicking the tires a bit more. I can’t wait for my next project so I have a chance to create something new.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/google-glass-as-a-tool">Google Glass as a tool</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><a href="/images/google_glass_person.jpg"><img src="/images/google_glass_person.jpg" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a> is a new<sup id="fnref:20130521080110"><a href="#fn:20130521080110" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, wearable technology that incorporates a screen, microphone, and camera into a glasses-like form factor. Most<sup id="fnref:20130521080295"><a href="#fn:20130521080295" class="footnote">2</a></sup> of what I’ve read about it so far as been fairly negative with comments ranging from how bad you’ll look wearing them to how much of an invasion of privacy it is when people can take your picture at any time without them noticing. In his typically outrageous manner, Ben Brooks has even <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/05/glassholes/">suggested outlawing them</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these complaints, while at least partially valid, are also myopic.<sup id="fnref:20130521080585"><a href="#fn:20130521080585" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Fashion is fickle and their design can change; cellphones, spy cameras, and digital SLRs with telephoto lenses got rid of privacy long ago; and, Ben, taking photos of people without their permission in public is perfectly legal. Yeah, even if it’s of your kid.<sup id="fnref:20130521080869"><a href="#fn:20130521080869" class="footnote">4</a></sup> They also seem to overlook or have no image about how useful they could be. </p>

<p>What interests me about Google Glass is not how it might be used in social situations<sup id="fnref:20130521081069"><a href="#fn:20130521081069" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, and the accompanying norms it may violate, but how this could be used as a tool, an extension of one’s self. </p>

<ul>
  <li>I imagine a rescue worker being able to view and tag dangerous situations in some wreckage, while leaving their hands free or perhaps easily and quickly taking images of an injured survivor that could be uploaded and reviewed at the central medical center so that preparations could be made before the patient even arrives. </li>
  <li>I imagine a doctor doing a procedure being able to monitor an ultrasound image or telemetry while not taking his eyes off the patient. </li>
  <li>I imagine being about to keep a menu or manual right in my field of vision while cooking or fixing the car, without awkwardly perching it somewhere not quite easy to see and not quite out of the danger zone. </li>
  <li>I imagine that every time I looked at a document containing the words of some diagnosis, Glass would automatically search for the ICD-10 code and if I happened to need it, I could quickly glance up at the screen. </li>
  <li>I imagine seeing a patient and when I start talking about the treatment, Glass connects to my electronic chart to look up their insurance coverage and list in my field of vision which medication is covered so I can continue explaining the treatment uninterrupted. </li>
</ul>

<p>My first thought when hearing about Glass was how useful this would be for parents of infants. One mother already wrote about how useful it is<sup id="fnref:20130521093210"><a href="#fn:20130521093210" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Sure, I can’t imaging people wearing these all the time in every social situation<sup id="fnref:20130521082208"><a href="#fn:20130521082208" class="footnote">7</a></sup>, but who said you had to?<sup id="fnref:20130521082632"><a href="#fn:20130521082632" class="footnote">8</a></sup> I may never wear it while at a restaurant or a party, but who cares if I look dorky while walking around my own house? I don’t wear my pajamas outside either. While most agree that bluetooth headsets are dorky, it’s not the same when wearer is the receptionist sitting at the desk of your local law office or clinic answering phones all day. In that same situation, I can imagine the practice management software being able to identify the person checking in, pull up her chart, take a picture of the patient’s new insurance card and upload it to the billing software, while leaving the receptionist’s hands free for other things.</p>

<p>Social norms may have to adapt or may have to be more strongly reiterated to put those who would abuse this, or any, technology<sup id="fnref:20130521084058"><a href="#fn:20130521084058" class="footnote">9</a></sup>, but if we can get past the idea of this being a social device and start to look at it more as a tool, suddenly, this technology seems a lot more interesting. </p>

<p>I have no prediction as to the business success of Glass and the functionality will greatly depend on how good the software is. Google has already let me down enough times that I’m cautious. But I am curious. </p>
