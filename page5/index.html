  <p>When the three dogs attacked an 11-year-old boy riding the dirt bike he had gotten for Christmas, neighbor Benjamin Srigley jumped in to help. He retrieved his 9mm Ruger P-90 handgun from his house and fatally shot one the animals. A D.C. police officer shot and killed the other two.</p>

  <p>But the 39-year-old’s actions — deemed heroic by the boy’s relatives — quickly became complicated. Authorities say Srigley had <em>legally bought the handgun and two other firearms in Virginia</em>, but he had failed to register them in the District.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Two-improvements-with-Keyboard-Maestro-6">Two improvements with Keyboard Maestro 6</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I’m a big fan of <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> and use it both daily for my workflow as well as occasionally for projects as they arise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Version 6.0</a> was released today and is a major upgrade over version 5. There are many improvements both major, minor, and cosmetic. It was well worth the $25 upgrade price.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/">Macdrifter</a> has a nice write up and I’m sure that <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/keyboard-maestro-6-0-adds-syncing-browser-actions-device-triggers-and-more/">Macstories</a> will have a very detailed review within a few weeks.</p>

<p>Today I’m just going to share two small items made possible with the new version.</p>

<h2 id="shorter-macros-with-browser-text-tokens">Shorter macros with browser text tokens</h2>

<p>First, some types of macros are more easy to create and are smaller due to the <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/documentation/6/tokens.html">new web browser text tokens</a>. I had <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/post/Switching-the-current-viewed-webpage-between-Safari-and-Chrome">previously created a macro</a> that would take an URL that was currently open in Safari and open it in Chrome instead, and vice versa. </p>

<p>The macro in version 5 is fairly long:</p>

<p><a href="/images/switching_browsers_KM5.jpg"><img src="/images/switching_browsers_KM5.jpg" alt="Switching browsers in KM5 macro" /></a></p>

<p>The same macro in version 6 is much smaller:</p>

<p><a href="/images/switching_browsers_KM6.jpg"><img src="/images/switching_browsers_KM6.jpg" alt="Switching browsers in KM6 macro" /></a></p>

<p>This is all directly or indirectly because there is a text token for the current URL in both web browsers. This gets rid of the AppleScript for getting the URL. It also indirectly allows me to get rid of commands to open the opposite web browser as well as to wait for that browser to be open. In the version 5 macro, I had a command to switch to the new browser since that was necessary in order to enter the URL into the address bar. Since in my situation, I may not want to immediately switch over to the other browser, I was able to leave that off too.</p>

<h2 id="easy-creation-of-markdown-links-from-current-webpage">Easy creation of Markdown links from current webpage</h2>

<p>Seeing how easy it was to change the above macro, I decided to make a quick macro to make a Markdown link using the current Safari URL as the link URL and the current Safari window title as the link text. I also used the new text token <code>%|%</code> to place the cursor in position to quickly change the link text in case the window title isn’t appropriate.</p>

<p><a href="/images/MD_link_from_Safari_title_url.jpg"><img src="/images/MD_link_from_Safari_title_url.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I’m looking forward to upgrading my old macros and kicking the tires a bit more. I can’t wait for my next project so I have a chance to create something new.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/google-glass-as-a-tool">Google Glass as a tool</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><a href="/images/google_glass_person.jpg"><img src="/images/google_glass_person.jpg" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Google Glass</a> is a new<sup id="fnref:20130521080110"><a href="#fn:20130521080110" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, wearable technology that incorporates a screen, microphone, and camera into a glasses-like form factor. Most<sup id="fnref:20130521080295"><a href="#fn:20130521080295" class="footnote">2</a></sup> of what I’ve read about it so far as been fairly negative with comments ranging from how bad you’ll look wearing them to how much of an invasion of privacy it is when people can take your picture at any time without them noticing. In his typically outrageous manner, Ben Brooks has even <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/05/glassholes/">suggested outlawing them</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these complaints, while at least partially valid, are also myopic.<sup id="fnref:20130521080585"><a href="#fn:20130521080585" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Fashion is fickle and their design can change; cellphones, spy cameras, and digital SLRs with telephoto lenses got rid of privacy long ago; and, Ben, taking photos of people without their permission in public is perfectly legal. Yeah, even if it’s of your kid.<sup id="fnref:20130521080869"><a href="#fn:20130521080869" class="footnote">4</a></sup> They also seem to overlook or have no image about how useful they could be. </p>

<p>What interests me about Google Glass is not how it might be used in social situations<sup id="fnref:20130521081069"><a href="#fn:20130521081069" class="footnote">5</a></sup>, and the accompanying norms it may violate, but how this could be used as a tool, an extension of one’s self. </p>

<ul>
  <li>I imagine a rescue worker being able to view and tag dangerous situations in some wreckage, while leaving their hands free or perhaps easily and quickly taking images of an injured survivor that could be uploaded and reviewed at the central medical center so that preparations could be made before the patient even arrives. </li>
  <li>I imagine a doctor doing a procedure being able to monitor an ultrasound image or telemetry while not taking his eyes off the patient. </li>
  <li>I imagine being about to keep a menu or manual right in my field of vision while cooking or fixing the car, without awkwardly perching it somewhere not quite easy to see and not quite out of the danger zone. </li>
  <li>I imagine that every time I looked at a document containing the words of some diagnosis, Glass would automatically search for the ICD-10 code and if I happened to need it, I could quickly glance up at the screen. </li>
  <li>I imagine seeing a patient and when I start talking about the treatment, Glass connects to my electronic chart to look up their insurance coverage and list in my field of vision which medication is covered so I can continue explaining the treatment uninterrupted. </li>
</ul>

<p>My first thought when hearing about Glass was how useful this would be for parents of infants. One mother already wrote about how useful it is<sup id="fnref:20130521093210"><a href="#fn:20130521093210" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Sure, I can’t imaging people wearing these all the time in every social situation<sup id="fnref:20130521082208"><a href="#fn:20130521082208" class="footnote">7</a></sup>, but who said you had to?<sup id="fnref:20130521082632"><a href="#fn:20130521082632" class="footnote">8</a></sup> I may never wear it while at a restaurant or a party, but who cares if I look dorky while walking around my own house? I don’t wear my pajamas outside either. While most agree that bluetooth headsets are dorky, it’s not the same when wearer is the receptionist sitting at the desk of your local law office or clinic answering phones all day. In that same situation, I can imagine the practice management software being able to identify the person checking in, pull up her chart, take a picture of the patient’s new insurance card and upload it to the billing software, while leaving the receptionist’s hands free for other things.</p>

<p>Social norms may have to adapt or may have to be more strongly reiterated to put those who would abuse this, or any, technology<sup id="fnref:20130521084058"><a href="#fn:20130521084058" class="footnote">9</a></sup>, but if we can get past the idea of this being a social device and start to look at it more as a tool, suddenly, this technology seems a lot more interesting. </p>

<p>I have no prediction as to the business success of Glass and the functionality will greatly depend on how good the software is. Google has already let me down enough times that I’m cautious. But I am curious. </p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Using-PACS-from-a-Mac">Using PACS from a Mac</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>The title is a bit misleading, but I figured that’s what people would be searching for if they had the problem I’m intending to solve.</p>

<p>Technically, this article is about installing virtual Windows machines for free on your Mac so you can use PACS rather than about how to use PACS on a Mac, because, as far as I know, you can’t.</p>

<p>A colleague uses a Macbook Air at work except the hospitals imaging system uses PACS with some unfortunate software requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Internet Explorer 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0</li>
  <li>Windows XP (Service Pack 3) or Windows Vista Home Premium or Windows Vista Business 64 bit or Windows 7 32 and 64 bit </li>
  <li>Windows 3.1 Installer</li>
  <li>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 (Service Pack 1)</li>
  <li>Windows Media Player 11.0</li>
</ol>

<p>This made him sad because he also had to carry around a crappy Windows machine.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we were able to easily solve his problem today.<sup id="fnref:20130518185423"><a href="#fn:20130518185423" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The technique we used came from a <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/">2 year old article</a> from <a href="http://osxdaily.com">OSXDaily</a>. It uses VirtualBox from Oracle to create a virtual machine and then load a free version of Windows XP for the purposes of testing IE.</p>

<p>The technique is really pretty simple, although you need to not fear the terminal.</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">download and install Virtual Box</a>.</p>

<p>Second, go to the terminal<sup id="fnref:20130518191266"><a href="#fn:20130518191266" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and paste one of the following depending on the version of Internet Explorer you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 7</li>
</ul>

<p><code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="7" bash</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 8</li>
</ul>

<p><code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="8" bash</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 9</li>
</ul>

<p><code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="9" bash</code></p>

<p>In everything goes well, this will install the Windows operating system needed and the version of IE as well.</p>

<p>Finally, run the application VirtualBox and you’ll be able to boot up the Windows virtual machine.</p>

<p>If you have trouble doing that there are several more resources that can help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools">Microsoft’s virtualization website</a>. You can pick from Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://chriswharton.me/2013/02/installing-modern-ie-virtualization-on-virtualbox-for-mac/">Chris Warton’s blog</a>. Has some tips on installing one of the above Windowns virtual machines into Virtual Box. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">Greg Thornton’s Github repository</a> for automatic installation of Window’s VMs. Has more detailed instructions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know if this works for your and allows you to use PACS on your Mac. I’d be interested to know how much this is effecting physicians. </p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:20130518185423">
      <p>Actually, it took forever to figure it out. While this technique worked perfectly on my Macbook Air 13 inch, for some reason it would immediately fail on his machine. For some reason, the installer couldn’t make the hidden directory <code>.revms</code> in his User folder. Once we figured that out, un-hide the hidden files, and created it manually, it worked fine. Took forever to figure that part out though. <a href="#fnref:20130518185423" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <div class="content"><p>I created a Keyboard Maestro macro to quickly create a link-blog post to Scriptogram without even needing to open a text editor.</p>

<p>The workflow is straight forward and assumes that you are <em>reading a website in Safari and have already copied the quote you want to the clipboard</em>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are prompted for an attribution (either the author or the website you’re quoting), the title of your post which will also be used as the url of your post and part of the file name, tags (optional), and comments (optional).</li>
  <li>The url of the frontmost tab in Safari is saved as a variable.</li>
  <li>Text is written to a file.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="/images/Quick_link-blog_macro_image.png"><img src="/images/Quick_link-blog_macro_image.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Only three steps. The real power is in what text is written to a file and the name of the file.</p>

<p>The text is just the boilerplate of a Scriptogram blog post with variables to fill in the data.</p>

<pre><code>Title: %Variable%Post Title%
Date: %ICUDateTime%yyyy-M-d HH:mm%
Link: %Variable%currentURL%
Tags: %Variable%Tags%

[%Variable%Attribution%](%Variable%currentURL%):

&gt; %CurrentClipboard%

%Variable%Comments%
</code></pre>

<p>The text is written to a new file each time as long as the date and post title are unique. I like my file name to consist of the date and the post title as follows:</p>

<pre><code>/Users/michael/Dropbox/Apps/scriptogram/posts/%ICUDateTime%yyyy-M-d% %Variable%Post Title%.md
</code></pre>

<p>Took me all of 5-10 minutes. I surprised myself getting the whole thing correct on the first try. Typically it takes me half an hour to get the format of the macro set up and another 2 hours debugging it.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Creating-a-plain-text-wiki-with-nvALT">Creating a plain text wiki with nvALT</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When I was in medical school, they issued the student’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLIÉ">Sony Cliés</a>.<sup id="fnref:1365609755-Model"><a href="#fn:1365609755-Model" class="footnote">1</a></sup> It was an awesome little device for the time and I took a lot of notes on it while on rounds. Sadly, a few years later, I was unable to read the files when the Clié finally died and I was unable to read the files with any of the software on my computers.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been an advocate for plain text file. Plain text does not use any strange or proprietary formatting so the files can be read on any platform and in any app. The data is about as future-proof as you can get.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1161549/forget_fancy_formatting_why_plain_text_is_best.html">many other benefits to plain text as well</a>.</p>

<p>Although I use many apps on many devices to read my plain text files, my favorite by far is <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2012/02/28/nvalt-2-2-public-beta/">nvALT</a>. It is fast, responsive, intuitive, and created by <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/about/">a programmer I highly respect</a>. Unfortunately, it is free, but you can donate money like I did to support its continued development. </p>

<p>Today I found another useful way to use nvALT.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-plain-text-wiki">Creating a plain text wiki</h2>

<p>As I was reading an article on auto-inflammatory syndromes, I was struck with the idea of creating a list of all the rheumatology diseases. I hit my hotkey trigger to bring up nvALT and typed “rheumatology diseases” to see if I might have started such a list before. No results appeared, so I hit enter and the document with the title “rheumatology diseases” was created.</p>

<p>I copy and pasted the list of auto-inflammatory diseases into the note and went back to reading the article. As is typical, the article started with the first disease and moved down the list. <em>Now I wanted another text document about that disease in which I could write some notes</em>. While it wouldn’t be hard to do, wouldn’t it be nice if the original list of diseases could link to this other document so I could easily browse them in the future?</p>

<p>It happens that nvALT has an in-app feature<sup id="fnref:1365609755-fn1"><a href="#fn:1365609755-fn1" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that allows you to create links to other documents by wrapping the words in [[double brackets]]. Whatever words are in double brackets link to a note with the same words as the title. Example: “I love to eat [[chocolate]].” would link to a document with the name chocolate.txt. In my case, “FMF - [[familial Mediterranean fever]]” linked to a new document “familial Mediterranean fever.txt”.</p>

<p>As I read my way through the journal article, I created a new text document for each disease that is linked to from the disease list document. I imagine in this way, I could accidentally end up writing a book someday, or maybe just a good wiki for my website. Since I’m writing it all in Markdown anyway, the conversion would be relatively simple.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s simple. It’s elegant.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

    </li>
    <li id="fn:1365609755-fn1">
      <p>This means it works in the app, but won’t work elsewhere. Because the documents are plain text, this won’t break the document when read in other applications, but the link itself won’t be active. <a href="#fnref:1365609755-fn1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/morning-sickness-pill-again">The first US morning sickness pill, again</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>My dad told me a story as a kid about a good medicine that used to exist for morning sickness until some greedy nurse had a baby with birth defects and sued the company. They lost and the drug wasn’t profitable enough for them to continue making it in the face of potential future lawsuits and the precedence of that loss. They stopped making the drug. Sometimes, my dad would have the drug (really just a couple of over-the-counter pills) made up specially for certain patients. </p>

<p>At least that’s how I remember the story. </p>

<p>From this I learned several lessons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The legal system is not about justice. </li>
  <li>The people closest to the medical system are the ones who abuse it the most. </li>
  <li>Sometimes you have to take great risks to do the right thing. </li>
  <li>The good guy doesn’t always win. </li>
</ol>

<p>Looks like the drug is coming back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>U.S. doctors have had no officially approved treatment for morning sickness since lawsuits forced Bendectin off the market in 1983. But the drug’s main ingredients are vitamin B6 and an over-the-counter antihistamine, and obstetricians often advised pregnant women how to mix up the right dose themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2013-04-08/fda-approves-return-of-drug-for-morning-sickness">Businessweek</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>U.S. health regulators have approved a drug to treat morning sickness that was withdrawn from the market 30 years ago amid claims, since debunked, that it caused birth defects.</p>
