      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Using-PACS-from-a-Mac">Using PACS from a Mac</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>The title is a bit misleading, but I figured that’s what people would be searching for if they had the problem I’m intending to solve.</p>

<p>Technically, this article is about installing virtual Windows machines for free on your Mac so you can use PACS rather than about how to use PACS on a Mac, because, as far as I know, you can’t.</p>

<p>A colleague uses a Macbook Air at work except the hospitals imaging system uses PACS with some unfortunate software requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Internet Explorer 6.0, 7.0, or 8.0</li>
  <li>Windows XP (Service Pack 3) or Windows Vista Home Premium or Windows Vista Business 64 bit or Windows 7 32 and 64 bit </li>
  <li>Windows 3.1 Installer</li>
  <li>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 (Service Pack 1)</li>
  <li>Windows Media Player 11.0</li>
</ol>

<p>This made him sad because he also had to carry around a crappy Windows machine.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we were able to easily solve his problem today.<sup id="fnref:20130518185423"><a href="#fn:20130518185423" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The technique we used came from a <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/09/04/internet-explorer-for-mac-ie7-ie8-ie-9-free/">2 year old article</a> from <a href="http://osxdaily.com">OSXDaily</a>. It uses VirtualBox from Oracle to create a virtual machine and then load a free version of Windows XP for the purposes of testing IE.</p>

<p>The technique is really pretty simple, although you need to not fear the terminal.</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">download and install Virtual Box</a>.</p>

<p>Second, go to the terminal<sup id="fnref:20130518191266"><a href="#fn:20130518191266" class="footnote">2</a></sup> and paste one of the following depending on the version of Internet Explorer you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 7</li>
</ul>

<p><code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="7" bash</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 8</li>
</ul>

<p><code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="8" bash</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Explorer 9</li>
</ul>

<p><code>curl -s https://raw.github.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | IEVMS_VERSIONS="9" bash</code></p>

<p>In everything goes well, this will install the Windows operating system needed and the version of IE as well.</p>

<p>Finally, run the application VirtualBox and you’ll be able to boot up the Windows virtual machine.</p>

<p>If you have trouble doing that there are several more resources that can help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools">Microsoft’s virtualization website</a>. You can pick from Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://chriswharton.me/2013/02/installing-modern-ie-virtualization-on-virtualbox-for-mac/">Chris Warton’s blog</a>. Has some tips on installing one of the above Windowns virtual machines into Virtual Box. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">Greg Thornton’s Github repository</a> for automatic installation of Window’s VMs. Has more detailed instructions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know if this works for your and allows you to use PACS on your Mac. I’d be interested to know how much this is effecting physicians. </p>

      <p>Actually, it took forever to figure it out. While this technique worked perfectly on my Macbook Air 13 inch, for some reason it would immediately fail on his machine. For some reason, the installer couldn’t make the hidden directory <code>.revms</code> in his User folder. Once we figured that out, un-hide the hidden files, and created it manually, it worked fine. Took forever to figure that part out though. <a href="#fnref:20130518185423" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Keyboard-Maestro-link-blog-post-creator">Keyboard Maestro link-blog post creator for Scriptogram</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I created a Keyboard Maestro macro to quickly create a link-blog post to Scriptogram without even needing to open a text editor.</p>

<p>The workflow is straight forward and assumes that you are <em>reading a website in Safari and have already copied the quote you want to the clipboard</em>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are prompted for an attribution (either the author or the website you’re quoting), the title of your post which will also be used as the url of your post and part of the file name, tags (optional), and comments (optional).</li>
  <li>The url of the frontmost tab in Safari is saved as a variable.</li>
  <li>Text is written to a file.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="/images/Quick_link-blog_macro_image.png"><img src="/images/Quick_link-blog_macro_image.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Only three steps. The real power is in what text is written to a file and the name of the file.</p>

<p>The text is just the boilerplate of a Scriptogram blog post with variables to fill in the data.</p>

<pre><code>Title: %Variable%Post Title%
Date: %ICUDateTime%yyyy-M-d HH:mm%
Link: %Variable%currentURL%
Tags: %Variable%Tags%

[%Variable%Attribution%](%Variable%currentURL%):

&gt; %CurrentClipboard%

%Variable%Comments%
</code></pre>

<p>The text is written to a new file each time as long as the date and post title are unique. I like my file name to consist of the date and the post title as follows:</p>

<pre><code>/Users/michael/Dropbox/Apps/scriptogram/posts/%ICUDateTime%yyyy-M-d% %Variable%Post Title%.md
</code></pre>

<p>Took me all of 5-10 minutes. I surprised myself getting the whole thing correct on the first try. Typically it takes me half an hour to get the format of the macro set up and another 2 hours debugging it.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Creating-a-plain-text-wiki-with-nvALT">Creating a plain text wiki with nvALT</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When I was in medical school, they issued the student’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLIÉ">Sony Cliés</a>.<sup id="fnref:1365609755-Model"><a href="#fn:1365609755-Model" class="footnote">1</a></sup> It was an awesome little device for the time and I took a lot of notes on it while on rounds. Sadly, a few years later, I was unable to read the files when the Clié finally died and I was unable to read the files with any of the software on my computers.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been an advocate for plain text file. Plain text does not use any strange or proprietary formatting so the files can be read on any platform and in any app. The data is about as future-proof as you can get.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1161549/forget_fancy_formatting_why_plain_text_is_best.html">many other benefits to plain text as well</a>.</p>

<p>Although I use many apps on many devices to read my plain text files, my favorite by far is <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2012/02/28/nvalt-2-2-public-beta/">nvALT</a>. It is fast, responsive, intuitive, and created by <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/about/">a programmer I highly respect</a>. Unfortunately, it is free, but you can donate money like I did to support its continued development. </p>

<p>Today I found another useful way to use nvALT.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-plain-text-wiki">Creating a plain text wiki</h2>

<p>As I was reading an article on auto-inflammatory syndromes, I was struck with the idea of creating a list of all the rheumatology diseases. I hit my hotkey trigger to bring up nvALT and typed “rheumatology diseases” to see if I might have started such a list before. No results appeared, so I hit enter and the document with the title “rheumatology diseases” was created.</p>

<p>I copy and pasted the list of auto-inflammatory diseases into the note and went back to reading the article. As is typical, the article started with the first disease and moved down the list. <em>Now I wanted another text document about that disease in which I could write some notes</em>. While it wouldn’t be hard to do, wouldn’t it be nice if the original list of diseases could link to this other document so I could easily browse them in the future?</p>

<p>It happens that nvALT has an in-app feature<sup id="fnref:1365609755-fn1"><a href="#fn:1365609755-fn1" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that allows you to create links to other documents by wrapping the words in [[double brackets]]. Whatever words are in double brackets link to a note with the same words as the title. Example: “I love to eat [[chocolate]].” would link to a document with the name chocolate.txt. In my case, “FMF - [[familial Mediterranean fever]]” linked to a new document “familial Mediterranean fever.txt”.</p>

<p>As I read my way through the journal article, I created a new text document for each disease that is linked to from the disease list document. I imagine in this way, I could accidentally end up writing a book someday, or maybe just a good wiki for my website. Since I’m writing it all in Markdown anyway, the conversion would be relatively simple.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s simple. It’s elegant.</p>

    </li>
    <li id="fn:1365609755-fn1">
      <p>This means it works in the app, but won’t work elsewhere. Because the documents are plain text, this won’t break the document when read in other applications, but the link itself won’t be active. <a href="#fnref:1365609755-fn1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/morning-sickness-pill-again">The first US morning sickness pill, again</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>My dad told me a story as a kid about a good medicine that used to exist for morning sickness until some greedy nurse had a baby with birth defects and sued the company. They lost and the drug wasn’t profitable enough for them to continue making it in the face of potential future lawsuits and the precedence of that loss. They stopped making the drug. Sometimes, my dad would have the drug (really just a couple of over-the-counter pills) made up specially for certain patients. </p>

<p>At least that’s how I remember the story. </p>

<p>From this I learned several lessons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The legal system is not about justice. </li>
  <li>The people closest to the medical system are the ones who abuse it the most. </li>
  <li>Sometimes you have to take great risks to do the right thing. </li>
  <li>The good guy doesn’t always win. </li>
</ol>

<p>Looks like the drug is coming back:</p>

  <p>U.S. doctors have had no officially approved treatment for morning sickness since lawsuits forced Bendectin off the market in 1983. But the drug’s main ingredients are vitamin B6 and an over-the-counter antihistamine, and obstetricians often advised pregnant women how to mix up the right dose themselves.</p>

  <p>U.S. health regulators have approved a drug to treat morning sickness that was withdrawn from the market 30 years ago amid claims, since debunked, that it caused birth defects.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/patient-satisfaction-dilemma">The Patient Satisfaction Dilemma</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><a href="http://www.agraphia.net/the-patient-satisfaction-dilemma/">Zac at Agraphia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a click of a button I can easily do all these things, even when I know I shouldn’t.  And I’ll get paid more.  And I’ll avoid lawsuits.  And my patient interactions will be far more pleasant.  I suppose in the end, I try to do the right thing instead of the easy thing because I firmly believe that my duty is to take care of my patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no way around the fact that there will always be some amount of paternalism in medicine because there will always be a significant knowledge gap between the physician and the patient. </p>

<p>When “satisfaction” is taken to the extreme as a marker of quality and when “making the customer happy” becomes the primary rule in a clinic, good physicians will suffer great psychological pressure and patients will be at risk. </p>

<p>I think the ER is the place where we will see the worst consequences of this mandate. </p>

      <div class="content"><p><a href="http://smilesoftware.com">Smile</a> makes some of my favorite software.

<p>Today they launched version 6 of their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen-6/id609301478?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen-6/id609301478?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro</a> application for the Mac. </p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpenpro-6/id609313570?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro is $40</a></p>

<p>PDFpen Pro is a powerful PDF editor. It has the simple editing functions typical of what you would expect even on an iOS app: highlighting, notes, commenting, shapes, stamps, signatures, deskewing, resampling, cropping, etc..</p>

<p>The real power comes from its other editing abilities.</p>

<h2 id="redacting-information">Redacting Information</h2>

<p>You can redact text either by deleting it and replacing it with a black bar, a la spy movies, or delete it completely and leave it blank. </p>

<p>Example: The ACR has an excellent handout on a certain disease but one line is outdated. Rather than re-creating the whole PDF, just remove the one outdated line. </p>

<p>Example: Need to send your tax return to some company, but don’t want your social security exposed? You can do a search and replace redaction through the entire document in just a few seconds.</p>

<h2 id="make-non-fillable-pdfs-fillable">Make Non-Fillable PDFs Fillable</h2>

<p>It seems to be a bad habit in medical administration to use a scanned copy of an old paper document for application forms rather than creating fresh, fillable PDFs. We both know that we will never change the archaic practices of established medical organizations like state medical boards, but that doesn’t mean we have to be slaves to them. </p>

<p>Rather than suffering this indignity, open the PDF with PDFpen Pro and choose <code>Edit &gt; Create Form Fields</code>. PDFpen Pro will go through and find all the places that should be fillable and create them. Now you can complete the PDF as easily as is possible and email it back. </p>

<p>Here’s an example I did with my own consult order form:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/MTMG%20consult%20order%20form.pdf">Here is the PDF that was made by exporting from Pages</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/MTMG%20consult%20order%20form%20fillable2.pdf">And here the same PDF after using the PDFpen Pro</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly the second option is more professional and easier for the user to complete.</p>

<p>If you happen to be one of those “established medical organizations” I mentioned, then you can make your own forms fillable now and save your customers time and yourself the hassle of trying to read doctor handwriting.</p>

<p><strong>I also used this in my clinic to turn the radiology departments order form into a fillable PDF that automatically inserted the correct days date, my signature, and a pick menu of the common reasons I order imagine studies with the associated ICD-9 codes.</strong></p>

<h2 id="create-pdf-forms">Create PDF Forms</h2>

<p>Especially if you are a professional (individual or organization), the forms you host on the internet should be clean, fresh PDFs that are fillable, rather than blurry, tilted, off-center scans of old word documents. PDFpen Pro has complete features to create fillable PDFs including check boxes, radio buttons, drop-down pick lists, and fillable text boxes. You can create new PDFs from scratch in PDFpen Pro, or import PDFs created in other applications like Word or Pages and add the fillable areas. </p>

<h2 id="turn-pdfs-into-word-documents">Turn PDFs Into Word Documents</h2>

<p>An interesting new feature of PDFpen Pro version 6 is the ability to take a PDF document and turn it into an editable Word document. I’m not sure if this is a feature I’d use myself since I can already edit PDFs with PDFpen Pro and I don’t use Word, but other professionals have told me that this is something they’re really excited about.</p>

<p>David Sparks, lawyer, has an <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2013/3/pdfpen-version-6">excellent blog post with an 8 minute video</a> including an example of this. </p>

<h2 id="watermarking">Watermarking</h2>

<p>Want to send out a PDF to others but either make sure that your intellectually property is marked, or that it’s clearly labeled as a <code>draft</code>? PDFpen Pro can easily watermark every page of a document so that your message is clear.</p>

<h2 id="ocr">OCR</h2>

<p>In addition, I also use PDFpen Pro to OCR documents for me. OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition and is the process by which computers take a flat image and find the words inside that image. For example, you are probably aware that when you type a document you can search inside that document for a specific word, but if you have a picture in that document and there happens to be a word in the picture it will not find the word. When you scan a document or take a picture of the document, the words themselves are not recognized. To make the words machine readable, you need to use OCR.</p>

<p>PDFpen Pro has a fast and accurate OCR. When I scan bills, contracts, patient records, and any other documents, I always make sure to OCR them so I can later search within the document. If I take a photo of a document with my iPhone, it uploads to a Dropbox folder and PDFpen Pro OCRs the document so it’s searchable later. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You have 100 pages of outside records on a patient. You want to know if they have previously been on azathioprine. If your document was scanned without being OCR’d, which has been the case in every clinic and hospital I’ve worked at, then you have to flip through every page manually looking for the word. On the other hand, if you OCR’d the document, then you can just search for <code>azathioprine</code>.</p>

<p>You can open a document in PDFpen Pro and have it OCR the document for you. Better yet, you can get really nerdy and use scripts written by others to watch for any new PDFs added to a specific folder (for example, your <code>patient records</code> folder) and automatically OCR them without bothering you.</p>

<p>I also use this technique whenever I’m on a webpage with image text that I want to save and manipulate. I take a screenshot that is automatically saved to the desktop, I add “OCR” to the file name, and PDFpen Pro sees that (via a Hazel task) and automatically OCRs it for me.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>PDFpen and PDFpen Pro can be bought either on the Mac App Store or directly from Smile. The MAS version includes iCloud syncing, which is not available with the direct purchase option.</p>

<p><strong>The MAS versions are on sale today and tomorrow only.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen-6/id609301478?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen is $30</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpenpro-6/id609313570?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro is $40</a> and includes these features that are missing from the non-pro version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Convert websites to multi-page PDFs, complete with hyperlinks</li>
  <li>Create and edit cross-platform fillable PDF forms</li>
  <li>Create and edit document Table of Contents</li>
  <li>Create form fields automatically in a non-interactive form</li>
  <li>Edit document permissions to restrict saving, printing, copying, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This compares with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro.html">Adobe Acrobat XI Standard for $139</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro.html">Adobe Acrobat XI Pro for $199</a>.</p>

<p>I own the Pro version from the MAS.</p>

<p>So, now you know and if I see you putting non-fillable, scanned PDFs on your website, doctor, I will make fun of you. </p>
