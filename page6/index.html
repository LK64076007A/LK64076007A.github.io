      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Creating-a-plain-text-wiki-with-nvALT">Creating a plain text wiki with nvALT</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>When I was in medical school, they issued the student’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLIÉ">Sony Cliés</a>.<sup id="fnref:1365609755-Model"><a href="#fn:1365609755-Model" class="footnote">1</a></sup> It was an awesome little device for the time and I took a lot of notes on it while on rounds. Sadly, a few years later, I was unable to read the files when the Clié finally died and I was unable to read the files with any of the software on my computers.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been an advocate for plain text file. Plain text does not use any strange or proprietary formatting so the files can be read on any platform and in any app. The data is about as future-proof as you can get.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1161549/forget_fancy_formatting_why_plain_text_is_best.html">many other benefits to plain text as well</a>.</p>

<p>Although I use many apps on many devices to read my plain text files, my favorite by far is <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2012/02/28/nvalt-2-2-public-beta/">nvALT</a>. It is fast, responsive, intuitive, and created by <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/about/">a programmer I highly respect</a>. Unfortunately, it is free, but you can donate money like I did to support its continued development. </p>

<p>Today I found another useful way to use nvALT.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-plain-text-wiki">Creating a plain text wiki</h2>

<p>As I was reading an article on auto-inflammatory syndromes, I was struck with the idea of creating a list of all the rheumatology diseases. I hit my hotkey trigger to bring up nvALT and typed “rheumatology diseases” to see if I might have started such a list before. No results appeared, so I hit enter and the document with the title “rheumatology diseases” was created.</p>

<p>I copy and pasted the list of auto-inflammatory diseases into the note and went back to reading the article. As is typical, the article started with the first disease and moved down the list. <em>Now I wanted another text document about that disease in which I could write some notes</em>. While it wouldn’t be hard to do, wouldn’t it be nice if the original list of diseases could link to this other document so I could easily browse them in the future?</p>

<p>It happens that nvALT has an in-app feature<sup id="fnref:1365609755-fn1"><a href="#fn:1365609755-fn1" class="footnote">2</a></sup> that allows you to create links to other documents by wrapping the words in [[double brackets]]. Whatever words are in double brackets link to a note with the same words as the title. Example: “I love to eat [[chocolate]].” would link to a document with the name chocolate.txt. In my case, “FMF - [[familial Mediterranean fever]]” linked to a new document “familial Mediterranean fever.txt”.</p>

<p>As I read my way through the journal article, I created a new text document for each disease that is linked to from the disease list document. I imagine in this way, I could accidentally end up writing a book someday, or maybe just a good wiki for my website. Since I’m writing it all in Markdown anyway, the conversion would be relatively simple.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s simple. It’s elegant.</p>

    <li id="fn:1365609755-fn1">
      <p>This means it works in the app, but won’t work elsewhere. Because the documents are plain text, this won’t break the document when read in other applications, but the link itself won’t be active. <a href="#fnref:1365609755-fn1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/morning-sickness-pill-again">The first US morning sickness pill, again</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>My dad told me a story as a kid about a good medicine that used to exist for morning sickness until some greedy nurse had a baby with birth defects and sued the company. They lost and the drug wasn’t profitable enough for them to continue making it in the face of potential future lawsuits and the precedence of that loss. They stopped making the drug. Sometimes, my dad would have the drug (really just a couple of over-the-counter pills) made up specially for certain patients. </p>

<p>At least that’s how I remember the story. </p>

<p>From this I learned several lessons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The legal system is not about justice. </li>
  <li>The people closest to the medical system are the ones who abuse it the most. </li>
  <li>Sometimes you have to take great risks to do the right thing. </li>
  <li>The good guy doesn’t always win. </li>
</ol>

<p>Looks like the drug is coming back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>U.S. doctors have had no officially approved treatment for morning sickness since lawsuits forced Bendectin off the market in 1983. But the drug’s main ingredients are vitamin B6 and an over-the-counter antihistamine, and obstetricians often advised pregnant women how to mix up the right dose themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2013-04-08/fda-approves-return-of-drug-for-morning-sickness">Businessweek</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>U.S. health regulators have approved a drug to treat morning sickness that was withdrawn from the market 30 years ago amid claims, since debunked, that it caused birth defects.</p>
</blockquote>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/patient-satisfaction-dilemma">The Patient Satisfaction Dilemma</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><a href="http://www.agraphia.net/the-patient-satisfaction-dilemma/">Zac at Agraphia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a click of a button I can easily do all these things, even when I know I shouldn’t.  And I’ll get paid more.  And I’ll avoid lawsuits.  And my patient interactions will be far more pleasant.  I suppose in the end, I try to do the right thing instead of the easy thing because I firmly believe that my duty is to take care of my patients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no way around the fact that there will always be some amount of paternalism in medicine because there will always be a significant knowledge gap between the physician and the patient. </p>

<p>When “satisfaction” is taken to the extreme as a marker of quality and when “making the customer happy” becomes the primary rule in a clinic, good physicians will suffer great psychological pressure and patients will be at risk. </p>

<p>I think the ER is the place where we will see the worst consequences of this mandate. </p>

<p>Today they launched version 6 of their <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen-6/id609301478?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpen-6/id609301478?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro</a> application for the Mac. </p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpenpro-6/id609313570?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro is $40</a></p>

<p>PDFpen Pro is a powerful PDF editor. It has the simple editing functions typical of what you would expect even on an iOS app: highlighting, notes, commenting, shapes, stamps, signatures, deskewing, resampling, cropping, etc..</p>

<p>The real power comes from its other editing abilities.</p>

<h2 id="redacting-information">Redacting Information</h2>

<p>You can redact text either by deleting it and replacing it with a black bar, a la spy movies, or delete it completely and leave it blank. </p>

<p>Example: The ACR has an excellent handout on a certain disease but one line is outdated. Rather than re-creating the whole PDF, just remove the one outdated line. </p>

<p>Example: Need to send your tax return to some company, but don’t want your social security exposed? You can do a search and replace redaction through the entire document in just a few seconds.</p>

<h2 id="make-non-fillable-pdfs-fillable">Make Non-Fillable PDFs Fillable</h2>

<p>It seems to be a bad habit in medical administration to use a scanned copy of an old paper document for application forms rather than creating fresh, fillable PDFs. We both know that we will never change the archaic practices of established medical organizations like state medical boards, but that doesn’t mean we have to be slaves to them. </p>

<p>Rather than suffering this indignity, open the PDF with PDFpen Pro and choose <code>Edit &gt; Create Form Fields</code>. PDFpen Pro will go through and find all the places that should be fillable and create them. Now you can complete the PDF as easily as is possible and email it back. </p>

<p>Here’s an example I did with my own consult order form:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/MTMG%20consult%20order%20form.pdf">Here is the PDF that was made by exporting from Pages</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/MTMG%20consult%20order%20form%20fillable2.pdf">And here the same PDF after using the PDFpen Pro</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly the second option is more professional and easier for the user to complete.</p>

<p>If you happen to be one of those “established medical organizations” I mentioned, then you can make your own forms fillable now and save your customers time and yourself the hassle of trying to read doctor handwriting.</p>

<p><strong>I also used this in my clinic to turn the radiology departments order form into a fillable PDF that automatically inserted the correct days date, my signature, and a pick menu of the common reasons I order imagine studies with the associated ICD-9 codes.</strong></p>

<h2 id="create-pdf-forms">Create PDF Forms</h2>

<p>Especially if you are a professional (individual or organization), the forms you host on the internet should be clean, fresh PDFs that are fillable, rather than blurry, tilted, off-center scans of old word documents. PDFpen Pro has complete features to create fillable PDFs including check boxes, radio buttons, drop-down pick lists, and fillable text boxes. You can create new PDFs from scratch in PDFpen Pro, or import PDFs created in other applications like Word or Pages and add the fillable areas. </p>

<h2 id="turn-pdfs-into-word-documents">Turn PDFs Into Word Documents</h2>

<p>An interesting new feature of PDFpen Pro version 6 is the ability to take a PDF document and turn it into an editable Word document. I’m not sure if this is a feature I’d use myself since I can already edit PDFs with PDFpen Pro and I don’t use Word, but other professionals have told me that this is something they’re really excited about.</p>

<p>David Sparks, lawyer, has an <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2013/3/pdfpen-version-6">excellent blog post with an 8 minute video</a> including an example of this. </p>

<p>Want to send out a PDF to others but either make sure that your intellectually property is marked, or that it’s clearly labeled as a <code>draft</code>? PDFpen Pro can easily watermark every page of a document so that your message is clear.</p>

<h2 id="ocr">OCR</h2>

<p>In addition, I also use PDFpen Pro to OCR documents for me. OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition and is the process by which computers take a flat image and find the words inside that image. For example, you are probably aware that when you type a document you can search inside that document for a specific word, but if you have a picture in that document and there happens to be a word in the picture it will not find the word. When you scan a document or take a picture of the document, the words themselves are not recognized. To make the words machine readable, you need to use OCR.</p>

<p>PDFpen Pro has a fast and accurate OCR. When I scan bills, contracts, patient records, and any other documents, I always make sure to OCR them so I can later search within the document. If I take a photo of a document with my iPhone, it uploads to a Dropbox folder and PDFpen Pro OCRs the document so it’s searchable later. </p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> You have 100 pages of outside records on a patient. You want to know if they have previously been on azathioprine. If your document was scanned without being OCR’d, which has been the case in every clinic and hospital I’ve worked at, then you have to flip through every page manually looking for the word. On the other hand, if you OCR’d the document, then you can just search for <code>azathioprine</code>.</p>

<p>You can open a document in PDFpen Pro and have it OCR the document for you. Better yet, you can get really nerdy and use scripts written by others to watch for any new PDFs added to a specific folder (for example, your <code>patient records</code> folder) and automatically OCR them without bothering you.</p>

<p>I also use this technique whenever I’m on a webpage with image text that I want to save and manipulate. I take a screenshot that is automatically saved to the desktop, I add “OCR” to the file name, and PDFpen Pro sees that (via a Hazel task) and automatically OCRs it for me.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>PDFpen and PDFpen Pro can be bought either on the Mac App Store or directly from Smile. The MAS version includes iCloud syncing, which is not available with the direct purchase option.</p>

<p><strong>The MAS versions are on sale today and tomorrow only.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpenpro-6/id609313570?mt=12&amp;partnerId=30&amp;siteID=l8AT4zEd6Ao">PDFpen Pro is $40</a> and includes these features that are missing from the non-pro version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Convert websites to multi-page PDFs, complete with hyperlinks</li>
  <li>Create and edit cross-platform fillable PDF forms</li>
  <li>Create and edit document Table of Contents</li>
  <li>Create form fields automatically in a non-interactive form</li>
  <li>Edit document permissions to restrict saving, printing, copying, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>This compares with <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro.html">Adobe Acrobat XI Standard for $139</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro.html">Adobe Acrobat XI Pro for $199</a>.</p>

<p>I own the Pro version from the MAS.</p>

<p>So, now you know and if I see you putting non-fillable, scanned PDFs on your website, doctor, I will make fun of you. </p>

      <div class="content"><p>Yesterday, a customer on the Keyboard Maestro forums wrote a thank you to Peter, the owner/developer of KM:</p>

  <p>Peter, I don’t know how you do it–all the work you do on KM, and still answering many questions in the forum. Just a note from one very appreciative customer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was quickly followed by “+1”s. </p>

<p>I have to agree that this echoes my sentiments too. I love KM as excellent software, but the extra work on answering (sometimes silly or rude questions) is really wonderful. </p>

<p>Even better was Peter’s deferential reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks Mike (and others!), your thoughts are greatly appreciated!</p>

  <p>It’s easy to say how I do it - I’m supported by all of you. I get to do what I love, work from home so I can walk my kids to school, make something that is useful to lots of people, and all because you folks all support me, both financially and by helping expand Keyboard Maestro to others.</p>

  <p>So by far it is me who needs to thank you all, not the other way around!</p>

  <p>Thanks,

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/The-safety-of-clone-backups">Clone Backups - Why and How</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>If you have valuable data on your computer you need to have a back up and more than one. Your data is likely priceless, irreplaceable and/or expensive to recover. If you’re anything like me, your data may consist of some of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photos
    <ul>
      <li>Military</li>
      <li>Med school graduation</li>
      <li>Wedding</li>
      <li>Children</li>
      <li>Clinical photos</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Music - entire collection of CDs long burned to digital and thrown away</li>
  <li>Movies
    <ul>
      <li>Home movies</li>
      <li>Hollywood movie rips from old DVDs long thrown away </li>
      <li>Training videos</li>
      <li>Conference talks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documents
    <ul>
      <li>Tax returns</li>
      <li>Business receipts</li>
      <li>Lease agreements </li>
      <li>Scans of all diplomas, licenses, etc. </li>
      <li>All utility bills</li>
      <li>Research papers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>You should back up the data frequently and redundantly. Hard drives do fail. Natural disasters, both weather and children, do happen. <a href="http://m.nydailynews.com/1.247700#bmb=1">Thieves do take things</a>. <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/">Hackers can wipe out everything</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to make multiple continuous backups with at least some of them stored off site. There are many easy and relatively inexpensive ways to do this, but today I just want to talk about one specific type of back up that I think is the most valuable. (<em>You still should do more than one kind.</em>) </p>

<h3 id="clone-backups">Clone Backups</h3>

<p>A clone backup is an identical copy of your hard drive including the operating system and not just the user data. This is a <em>bootable</em> copy of your computer meaning that if your hard drive wears out, gets stolen, is shot, whatever, you can plug your clone in and run it identically to the machine that just died. To be clear, if my drive dies in the middle of clinic, I pull the clone back up out of my bag, plug it in, reboot, and I’m back in business.</p>

<p>Most other forms of back up just back up user data, or are primarily designed to recover small amount of data at a time. While this is nice to have in the situation of catastrophic failure, it doesn’t do me much good if my hard drive dies in the middle of rounds or at conference before I have to give a presentation. </p>

<p>In those situations, I need <em>my</em> machine. I need a clone. </p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p><em>This is for Macs only. I’m sure Windows and Linux have their own software for doing this but I don’t use those products so I can’t make recommendations.</em></p>

<p>There are two excellent and easy to use programs that will make clone back ups for you: <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> and <a href="http://www.bombich.com">Carbon Copy Cloner</a>. They are both excellent and are staples of Mac nerds. I happen to use SuperDuper! but not for any particular reason. They are not available in the Mac App Store because they need very low level access to your computer to make the clone, which is not allowed for MAS apps. I’m always happily surprised when I go to upgrade my OS and their software is already upgraded for the new version. </p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p><em>The hardware is platform agnostic so you can use these on Mac, Windows, or Linux.</em></p>

<p>The other thing you’ll need to make a clone back up is a hard drive. At the bare minimum it needs to be big enough to hold your entire primary hard drive. In addition, I recommend that it be small so that you can carry it with you all the time, and have the fastest port possible for your machine so that the back ups are quick to make. The longer it takes to run, the less likely you are to do it. (<em>Think compliance with QID dosing versus QD dosing.</em>)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Larger than the drive it is cloning</li>
  <li>Small so it is portable</li>
  <li>Fast connection so backups are easier</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to speed there are two types of drives and two major types of connections: SSD vs HDD, and Thunderbolt vs USB 3.0.</p>

<p>SSDs (solid state drives) are newer, faster, and have no moving parts. They are the Ferrari of drives. They also cost as much. HDDs (hard disk drive) are the classic spinning disk drives. They are larger, store more, and are cheaper, but are also slower. </p>

<p>The Thunderbolt connection is an Intel product but so far has really only shown up in Mac computers. It is the fastest consumer external connection, but it is also very expensive. Often drives are sold without the cords, which themselves cost an extra $50. USB 3.0 is very fast compared to the previous generation USB 3.0 and is much cheaper. This is pretty ubiquitous now on new computers from Apple and Windows. </p>

<h4 id="ssd-fast-and-furious-with-a-price-to-match">SSD: fast and furious with a price to match</h4>

<p>If money is no object, I recommend an SSD with either Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 connection, depending on the fastest connection your computer has. The one caveat is that SSDs are typical smaller than HDD and are very expensive a larger sizes. If you have an 500GB+ HDD, then you’ll need to stick with an HDD. However, if like me, you have something like a Macbook Air with a 128 or 256 GB SSD, then this is a great option. For a top-of-the-line, blazingly fast, SSD/Thunderbolt drive, you can get the Elgato 240GB for $480. A really beautiful option, and only a bit slower but much cheaper, is the 240 GB OWC SSD/USB 3.0 <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/ENVPROU3S240/">Envoy Pro EX</a> for $320. (This is probably what I would get if I had the money. It’s not as fast, but way better looking.)</p>

<p>A few cheaper options include the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shadow-trade-240GB-External-Portable/dp/B004G7KK30/?tag=violeneces-20">U32 Shadow 240GB USB 2.0 SSD</a> for $250 and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Verbatim-Store-External-Solid-47622/dp/B008OE0S56/?tag=violeneces-20">Verbatim Store ‘n’ Go 128 GB USB 3.0 SSD</a> for $150.</p>

<h4 id="hdd-steady-and-solid">HDD: steady and solid</h4>

<p>A mid-range choice, and what I use, is a HDD with Thunderbolt connection. HDDs are significantly slower than SSDs but without the prohibitively high price. I can make two clone back ups on separate devices (one for home and one for work, i.e. off site back up) for the price of an SSD and the drives are still large enough for lots of extra storage space in addition. I have/use two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Thunderbolt-Portable-Drive/dp/B008D4X9UI/?tag=violeneces-20">Buffalo MiniStation 1 TB Thunderbolt / USB 3.0 Portable Hard Drive with Thunderbolt Cable</a>. This has both the USB 3.0 and the Thunderbolt connections and comes with both cables. The 1TB model is only $208 on Amazon right now and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Thunderbolt-Portable-Drive/dp/B008D4X9UI/?tag=violeneces-20">500GB is $143</a>.</p>

<p>If you drop the Thunderbolt connection for USB 3.0 you can significantly cut the price. A Buffalo drive with only USB 3.0 runs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Plus-Portable-Drive/dp/B005EJLFVK/?tag=violeneces-20">$70 for 500GB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Plus-Portable-Drive/dp/B005EJLFVK/?tag=violeneces-20">$84 for 1TB</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BUFFALO-MiniStation-Plus-Portable-Drive/dp/B005EJLFVK/?tag=violeneces-20">$200 for 2 TB</a>.</p>

<p>If you are on a shoe-string budget or only have a USB 2.0 connection then the specific model doesn’t matter as much. You can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Hard-Drive-WDBL1D5000ABK-NESN/dp/B005DKZW5A/?tag=violeneces-20">WD My Passport 500GB USB 2.0</a> but considering you can get a much better drive for $20 more and the speed will be agonizingly slow, I really don’t recommend going this route. The only way I’d do this is if you have hardly any money at all and already own an old USB 2.0 drive.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The first time you run the cloning software, it will take awhile. Depending on your connection it could be an hour to all night. After that it will much faster as it will only incrementally update changes. My updates typically take around 6 minutes. </p>

<p>Enjoy your new power and piece of mind. You just earned +10 nerd CME. </p>

      <div class="content"><p>I was sitting in a public place, minding my own business. An elderly gentleman sat down next to me and started to have a very loud phone conversation with what apparently was an insurance company. The salient points are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>His fiancé was in a car accident last week.</li>
  <li>She was hit from behind.</li>
  <li>She reportedly broke her sternum.</li>
  <li>She “is quite messed up.”</li>
</ol>

<p>He proceeded to slowly spell the name of his fiancé, the name of driver of the other car, and a bunch of personal details such as birth date, phone number, addresses, insurance numbers, etc.. The fiancé walked around, moved both arms with as normal of a range of motion as can be tested by observation alone, and carried a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Association-Family-Legal-Guide/dp/0812923618?tag=violeneces-20">book that weighs 4 lbs</a>.</p>

<p>After he got off the phone, she sat down and started going through the book, occasionally reading out a passage and the saying that they should get the lawyer to “add that charge.”</p>

<p>Then they thumbed through the yellow pages writing down numbers for attorneys.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Mute-commercials-on-CBS-or-Hulu-with-Keyboard-Maestro">Mute commercials on CBS or Hulu with Keyboard Maestro</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>In a game of one-upmanship, I’ve improved on my prior macros for muting commercials on CBS and Hulu. What used to be 1-3 non-annoying commercials<sup id="fnref:1363103721-fn1"><a href="#fn:1363103721-fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> has turned into five, highly-annoying, commercials in a row. The volume is often much louder than the volume of the show and not infrequently, the same commercial is played all 5 times.</p>

<p>To combat this I made two small changes. First, I combined the two macros into one so I don’t have to remember two hot keys or which site I’m watching. A simple Applescript snippet captures the URL from Chrome and an if/then statement looks for the network name in the url. The second change involves turning the screen off and on in addition to toggling the mute key.</p>

<p>The macro flows thus:</p>

<pre>
- Execute Applescript `tell application "Google Chrome" to get the URL of active tab of first window` and save results to variable `currentURL`
- If `currentURL` contains CBS then
    - Toggle system sound mute
    - Repeat action 16 times: decrease screen brightness
    - Execute following action until none of the conditions are met
        - none (this is basically just a pause until)
        - Conditions: screen contains image (the image is the "advertisement" graphic that is displayed during a commercial)
    - Toggle system sound mute
    - Repeat action 16 times: increase screen brightness
- otherwise execute the following
    - If `currentURL` contains hulu then
        - Toggle system sound mute
        - Repeat action 16 times: decrease screen brightness
        - Execute following action until none of the conditions are met
            - none (this is basically just a pause until)
            - Conditions: screen contains image (the image is the "advertisement" graphic that is displayed during a commercial)
        - Toggle system sound mute
        - Repeat action 16 times: increase screen brightness
    - otherwise do nothing
</pre>

<p>I haven’t figured out a way to automatically call this macro when the commercials start. I could watch for the “advertisement” graphic but I think that would be way too CPU intensive. I’ll keep thinking about it.</p>

<p>I encourage you to make your own macro to learn the system, and you might have to in order to get the correct “advertisement” graphic, but you can get mine <a href="/images/mute_Commercials.kmmacros">here</a>. (right click to download)</p>
