      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2012/12/07/mute-commercials.html">Mute commercials on CBS.com with Keyboard Maestro</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I watch TV on my Macbook Air on the weekends when I’m ironing. Sadly, commercials are becoming more popular with CBS airing 4 in a row, often the same exact commercial over and over. There’s no way to skip them, but I made a quick macro with Keyboard Maestro that mutes the sound until the commercials are over and then turns the sound back on.</p>

<p>You have to toggle the macro manually when the commercial starts, but otherwise, it works great.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Muting_CBS_macro.png"><img src="/images/Muting_CBS_macro.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>The macro is a very simple three steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Toggle System Sound Mute, turning off the sound.</li>
  <li>Watch for an image to disappear from the screen. The image is a screen capture of the word advertisement that overlays advertisements when they’re playing.</li>
  <li>Toggle System Sound Mute, turning on the sound.</li>
</ol>

<p>The picture I used to monitor:</p>

<p><a href="/images/Advertisement_image.png"><img src="/images/Advertisement_image.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>Now I don’t have to listen to annoying commercials.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Same macro with a slightly different picture works for Hulu. Also, now I’m occasionally seeing 5 commercials in a row.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2012/11/25/Podcasting-with-Squarespace.html">Podcasting with Squarespace</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>If you want to create a podcast, Squarespace is recommended as a complete solution for domain registration, hosting, bandwidth, and syndication. They even have a dedicated <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/customer/portal/articles/637686-podcasting-with-squarespace">instruction manual</a>. <strong>Update: The lack of analytics regarding total number of downloads for each episode of a podcast is a weakness, especially if you want to get sponsors.</strong></p>

<h1 id="tldr">tl:dr</h1>

<h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
<p>I recently decided to make a podcast. This was to be a small hobby, a minor side project, and so the technical aspects of the project couldn’t take up much of my time and energy. As I was preparing the content and looking at the best ways to turn this into a reality, it appeared that Squarespace could possibly be able to handle all the hosting, bandwidth, and even the domain registration. It turns out that this is correct and for the most part was quite easy.</p>

<p>I’ve used Squarespace before for several sites. Mostly I’ve used version 5 and haven’t quite gotten into version 6 yet. My past experience has been that they are very helpful with tech support the few times I’ve needed it, are very generous with long, free trials to test out the service, and are not pushy sales people. In fact, I’m not sure if they have sales people. They don’t even ask for your credit card number up front! These are decent folk.</p>

<p>Before I got started, I did have one question related to doing a podcasting site. On their <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/pricing/">pricing page</a> it stated that the maximum file size is 20mb; however, on <a href="http://help.squarespace.com/customer/portal/articles/637686-podcasting-with-squarespace">another page specifically about podcasting</a>, it stated the maximum size is 120mb. Well, which is it? This is the kind of straight forward question that if I normally ask a support person, they have no idea what I’m talking about, and if they even bother to compare the urls I send them, then never know what I’m talking about. My experience with the Squarespace support was the exact opposite. </p>

<p>I clicked on the support chat link on their website, was immediately helped by someone pleasant whose name I don’t remember and told simply that the normal limit is 20mb, but specifically for podcasting, it increases to 120mb. Perfect. With that verification, I was ready to go.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>First, at least mentally, I needed a domain. Squarespace gives you a free domain if you sign up for a year. Check.</p>

<p>Second, I needed a website. Well, that is the basic service of of Squarespace. I picked a template that was close to what I had imagined. It didn’t take me long to have a working prototype and over the next several days was able to turn it into something I was happy with. Honestly, I have no design or artistic sense, so it is a real testament to Squarespace’s platform that I was able to do this.</p>

<p>Third, I needed an RSS feed for my podcast that I can serve to podcast apps and to iTunes. Simply, Squarespace has already handled that. All you do is create a “blog” page, i.e. a single page that you can add sequential entries to. Then, when you have a podcast episode to publish, you create a blog entry and in that entry add an “audio block” which automagically creates a podcast feed. Squarespace takes care of the syndication and even puts a streaming player into that post. In addition, they have a preference to enable iTunes options so that it can be compatible  with and submitted to iTunes.</p>

<p>Fourth, I needed hosting for the podcast files. You can host them elsewhere such as <a href="http://libsyn.com">libsyn</a> or it may be possible depending on the size of your episodes and the number of downloads to get by with their cheaper plan with 500 GB of bandwidth and 2 GB of storage<sup id="fnref:121125232343"><a href="#fn:121125232343" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I wanted to splurge so I went for their unlimited place with unlimited bandwidth and storage<sup id="fnref:121125235024"><a href="#fn:121125235024" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. The storage is relatively easy for the most part. You upload your podcast audio file in the previously mentioned “audio block” and save it like you would any normal webpage.  </p>

<p>And just like that, I have a podcast.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<p>If I had to do it again, I wouldn’t even look for another alternative. It was great. Still, there are some rough edges that could be honed.</p>

<p>First, the file upload process for non-picture/audio/video files is so well hidden, I didn’t think it existed. If you want to upload a file like a PDF to your site, it is possible, but I doubt you’d ever find it on your own. When you are editing a page, the normal behavior is to click a plus sign button to add a block (widget). There are blocks for text, picture, audio, video, horizontal rules, and even blank space. There is no block for generic files. I clicked around for quite a while trying to figure it out. The answer is you first choose the text block, click on the “link” button as if you were going to make a text link, and in the next dialogue box is a place to upload a file. This seems to me to be a very unintuitive and misleading place to burry the file upload function. </p>

<p>Second, but related, there is no place to easily manage all your files. While you can access some of them from that same dialogue box, you cannot access them all. For example, after creating a podcast episode, I wanted to create a direct link in that post to the file for some that were having trouble getting it to play (IE 6, seriously?). There was no way that I could find in the interface to get access to this file in order to link it, or even just get its file name. I had to look at the source code of the rendered webpage to grab it.</p>

<p>These are two small, but significant problems that were so glaringly bad functionally that I have a hard time believing that they came from the same people who made the rest of the site so good.</p>

<p>Third, when selecting text to be edited in the “edit post” window, if the cursor went outside of the box after selecting text, the window exited the editing mode. </p>

<p>Fourth, when editing text in the “edit post” window, there are certain keystrokes that will cause the window to suddenly and glaringly jump to the bottom right of the screen for a 1/2 second and then return to the center. This happens, for example, when you type some text and hit the backspace key. This must be a frequent sequence of events unless no one else makes typos like I do. Again, this seems like an obvious bug that I’m surprised it hasn’t been fixed. </p>

<p>Again, overall, a great experience, I’d do it again, and I’m looking forward to using their platform for my podcast. Also, I think I’m finally ready to upgrade by Squarespace 5 site to version 6…next weekend.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2012/11/24/Mobile-document-scanning.html">Mobile document scanning</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>

<p>Scan documents with your smartphone, sync to your home computer with Dropbox, and have them automatically OCR’d so they’re searchable later.</p>

<h1 id="tldr">tl;dr</h1>

<p>Yesterday, I mentioned that one of the consistent apps on my home screen is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a>. It is a simple and elegant app with a straight forward purpose: take pictures of documents, save them as PDFs, and upload them to cloud-based services. </p>

<p>In the digital age in which many of us are trying to live a <a href="http://macsparky.com/paperless/" title="Paperless">Paperless</a> lifestyle, converting paper documents to digital ones is a necessary evil. Scanners of various types are necessary for this task. There is a continuum of power versus portability when it comes to scanners. The more powerful are less portable; the most portable are usually not that powerful. </p>

<p>At work, where I don’t need to be portable, but need lots of power to scan hundreds of pages of double-sided documents and auto-rotate the occasional upside down page, I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-Instant-Sheet-Fed-Macintosh/dp/B001XWCQO2?tag=violeneces-20">Fujistu ScanSnap S1500M</a>, and I wouldn’t want to use anything else. At home, where I’m a bit more portable, and typically am only scanning a few pages at once, I go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Doxie-Go-Rechargeable-Mobile-Scanner/dp/B0053TRH2M/ref=sr_1_1?tag=violeneces-20">Doxie Go</a>, which I can also take with me on trips if needed. </p>

<p>But then there are all the times when I’m not at work or home but want to scan something and that’s when I turn to the power of the modern smartphone camera and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a>. </p>

<p>I have three requirements when I scan documents. </p>

<p>First, all documents must be in PDF format. PDF is a universal standard that will not be going away anytime soon, and if it does every become obsolete, there are so many people that have depended on it, there will be many options created to convert PDFs to the next standard. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a> saves all images in this format. </p>

<p>Next, I need to be able to access to my documents from any of my devices. This means uploading them to <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">Dropbox</a>. If you don’t know what Dropbox is stop everything now and <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">go learn</a>. <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">Seriously</a>. Stop! Don’t read another word. <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">GO</a>. <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">GET</a>. <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">DROPBOX</a>. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a> can upload to Dropbox (and a bunch of other Cloud services I don’t use) and can be set to upload automatically.</p>

<p>Finally, all my documents must be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR’d</a>. Basically, OCR is the process by which software is used to analyze the image of a document and figure out what the characters are. Without OCR you have an unsearchable document that you can’t even copy and paste text out of. With OCR you can search for any words inside the document and copy and paste text from it elsewhere. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a> does not OCR, and frankly, I’m suspicious of any mobile OCR app at this time. I really want quality text conversion and so I prefer to use the more powerful software and processor on my desktop machine. </p>

<p>To OCR documents uploaded to <a href="http://db.tt/F6uGmiXz">Dropbox</a>, I have my home computer watch the folder I upload PDFs to from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a>, and when a new PDF is added, an Applescript is called that uses <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdfpenpro/id403758325?mt=12">PDFpen Pro</a> to OCR the document. All credit goes to David Sparks, AKA MacSparky, author of the aforementioned <a href="http://macsparky.com/paperless/" title="Paperless ebook">Paperless ebook</a>, for the technique to do this. <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2009/5/24/pdfpen-ocr-folder-action-script.html">He wrote about</a> using something called Folder Actions that he used to do this. In the comments of this post<sup id="fnref:121124223240"><a href="#fn:121124223240" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, there was a link to another site that did a similar thing using Hazel. <a href="http://www.documentsnap.com/hazel-rule-to-ocr-documents-using-pdfpen/">I use the Hazel method</a>, because I actually have many folders that are watched and OCR’d in a similar way, and having them all together in one application makes them easier to monitor.</p>

<p>So, when I’m returning the rental car at the end of a business trip, rather than saving the receipt for scanning at home fraught with the perils of trying not to wrinkle it in the carry on bag and also remember to scan it in the first place, I take a quick picture of it with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8">Scanner Pro</a> and forget about it, because it will be uploaded and OCR’d without any more input from me. The next time I need the receipt, I just search for “car rental receipt” in Spotlight and all those kinds of receipts appear.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2012/11/23/quitting-ascension.html">It's not me, it's you.</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I received a piece of mail today that I found insulting: my employer has hired an outside agency to determine if my son is my son.</p>

<p>Actually and technically, since my wife and I both work in the same company and the insurance is in her name, the letter was to my wife and was to verify that I am her husband and that our son is ours.</p>

<p>Riddled with corporate speak, this letter basically says that they don’t trust that everyone listed as a dependent–myself and my son–on my wife’s insurance is actually a dependent and that they want to make sure they aren’t paying for what they don’t have to be. Apparently, this is a company-wide initiative.</p>

<p>While I have no problem with companies verifying that there is no fraud occurring in their organization, I have multiple reasons to be upset with this letter.</p>

<p>First, in order to verify our status, this third party organization that I am not associated with in any way is demanding a copy of my marriage license, tax return with both our names on it, and my son’s birth certificate. If I don’t provide it to them in 2 weeks, we’ll lose our health insurance.</p>

<p>I’m not a low level corporate stooge. My wife and I were professionally recruited to this organization. We were interviewed by CEOs and COOs. The in-house recruiter helped find a school for my son. I have meetings regularly with my office manager, the regional manager, and the COO. The idea that this small family, 2/3’s of whom are salaried employees of the company, cannot be locally verified is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Also, there’s no reason that every employee shouldn’t be granted the same respect and it would not be difficult to do as I’ll explain later. </p>

<p>Second, our organization is infested with managers. It would take very little effort to have us present the same documentation to our local managers, who could feed this up the food chain. It’s the same way they verify we all get our yearly flu shots or have maintained our licenses. This way, the private information remains local and within the organization I work for and the money that the organization is paying out would be saved. At a time when the organization is performing mass lay offs and crying about how they are losing money, I cannot believe they are wasting money like this.</p>

<p>Finally, given the nature of my work, I cannot just quit if I don’t like the policy. I must give 6 months notice of termination. So, if I don’t give them this information, at the best, I would give up my employee health insurance, which is a part of my compensation package. I’m not sure if this would qualify as breach of contract on their part, and I don’t want to be a trouble maker and fight to find out. </p>

<p>What I do know: my resignation letter will be on my manager’s desk Monday morning. </p>

<p>Sadly, that will not be because of a sudden, principled stand against this issue. Less dramatically, I’ve been contemplating leaving for some time due to other issues like this.</p>

<p>I am taking this as a lesson for when I am the boss and hopefully treat my employees with more respect.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2012/11/23/PDF-Expert-for-iPhone.html">PDF Expert for iPhone - attention to detail</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>PDF Expert for iPhone is a great app, and for today is free. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">Get it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>I’m a big fan of the iOS development company <a href="http://readdle.com/products/">Readdle</a> because I use their apps constantly in my personal and work life. <a href="http://readdle.com/products/">Their apps</a> are beautiful, consistently updated, and insanely good. I’ve also bought other company’s competing apps but due to various problems, I stick with Readdle and both PDF Expert and Scanner Pro are have long-standing positions on my home screen.</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/2012-11-23%2013.54.20.png"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/2012-11-23%2013.54.20.png" alt="" height="568" width="320" /></a></p>

<p>I have used PDF Expert on my iPhone and iPad to study for boards, read journal articles, and complete applications for medical licensure, hospital privileges, condo rental, and private school for my son.</p>

<p>Today, in honor of Black Friday, they’ve dramatically cut the prices on their apps, including making <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert for the iPhone free</a>. Personally, I just bought PDF Converter.<sup id="fnref:121123135732"><a href="#fn:121123135732" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There is way too much to talk about with regards to how great some of their apps are, and I have several blog posts planned to discuss how I use some of their apps in my workflow, but I do want to share one small aspect of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert</a> that demonstrates the attention to detail in these apps.</p>

<p>I read a lot of science articles that are in 2 column PDF format. On the iPhone, and even the iPad sometimes, the screen is too small to read more than a single column at a time. A lot of PDF readers screw up the scrolling when going from the end of one page to the beginning of the next. Most of the time, when you are zoomed in on the bottom right corner of the page, when you scroll to the next page, you are either looking at the top right corner of the next page (if scrolling to the next page vertically), or the bottom left (if scrolling horizontally). <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert</a> gets it right by going right to the next text you’ll be wanting to read at the top left of the page in either vertical or horizontal scrolling. </p>

<p>This is better understood with a picture:</p>

<p><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/PDF%20expert%20screen%20scroll.gif"><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3950369/blog_images/PDF%20expert%20screen%20scroll.gif" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Two other top apps for reading PDFs in my field are <a href="http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> and <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/iPhone/index.html">PDFpen</a> both of which have versions for the Mac, iPad, and iPhone. </p>

<p>Papers scrolls horizontally and goes to the bottom right of the next page–area 6 in the above image. While it is the top app for scientific article management, and I highly recommend using it, I don’t recommend using it for reading PDFs. </p>

<p>PDFpen’s behavior changes based if you’ve ever been on the page you’re scrolling to before. If you’ve never been there, it actually zooms out to look at the whole page. If you have been to that page before, it goes back to whatever zoom at whatever location you were at before. This inconsistent behavior is annoying. I would like it if it just zoomed to the whole page view and this was a preference you could toggle, but as it is, like most of the implementations of PDFpen, I find it unusable.<sup id="fnref:121123141713"><a href="#fn:121123141713" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So, if you need to read PDFs and even edit them, including signing documents and mailing them back, go get PDF Expert today.</p>

  <p>In the most commonly repeated complaint by patients, it is related how a person languished for months on a public waiting list for an appointment or procedure, but was seen within a week as a private patient. It is also common in the public system for scores of patients to be called for appointments at the same time, leading to long wait times, whereas in private medicine, individually timed appointments are the norm.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2012/10/13/Saving-sequential-webpages-with-Keyboard-Maestro.html">Saving sequential webpages as PDFs with Keyboard Maestro</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I needed to save as PDF a series of 80 webpages on a slow server on a password protected website. I could have sat there for an hour doing it manually, but since I wanted to get dressed and have a cup of coffee, I made a Keyboard Macro shortcut instead.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Saving_with_KM.png"><img src="/images/Saving_with_KM.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>In order to use this macro, you need to set up a very useful shortcut for saving files to PDF. In the stock OS, you hit ⌘-P (Command-P) to bring up the print dialogue box and then in the bottom left hand corner of the pop up menu click the down arrow by PDF and choose save as PDF. <strong>A much faster way  to do this,</strong> is to create a system shortcut that allows you to hit ⌘-P twice to initiate the save as PDF action. I learned this from MacSparky and <a href="http://macsparky.com/2008/3/19/keyboard-shortcut-for-save-as-pdf-in-os-x.html" title="still go to his page every time to remember how to set it up">still go to his page every time to remember how to set it up</a>.</p>

<p>The first two steps are to set up some incrementing variables to allow the files to be named with sequential numbers. If the webpages you’re saving have unique names, this won’t be necessary, but for my case it was.<sup id="fnref:1210130817"><a href="#fn:1210130817" class="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>

<p>The rest of the code is in a repeat loop. Since I knew it was going to be exactly 80 repeats, it was easier to do it this way than a while, or if loop. </p>

<p>The first part of the real code is to initiate the save as command with ⌘-P twice.</p>

<p>Then the file name is entered with the last digit being placed by a variable that will increment by +1 with every new name. Since the saving dialog seemed to take awhile, I added a pause into the mix. Then ⌘-down arrow moves the whole webpage to the very bottom where the “next page” button is. Keyboard Maestro has a powerful function to find images on a webpage and then use that image. In this case, when it sees the image of the next button, it left clicks the mouse in the center of the button. </p>

<p>The pages are slow to load, so I have a pause in there until the screen contains the image of a circular arrow. This is the refresh button in Safari and only shows up once a page is loaded. It’s an easy hack to make sure the next page is loaded. </p>

<p>And then this cycle repeats itself until all the pages were saved. It worked perfectly.</p>

<p>I didn’t even have time to do my hair and finish my coffee.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1210130817">
      <p>Setting the constant 1 to the variable i was probably unnecessary, but I was trying to get this done quickly, not elegantly.  <a href="#fnref:1210130817" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2012/09/20/Google-Maps-Fail.html">Google Maps Fail</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>Bashing Apple’s maps is the thing to do these days, but I just want to share my own Google Maps story. </p>

<p>When I was looking to move to Nashville two years ago I started looking for jobs by looking at hospitals I found on Google maps. There was one hospital on the map that I could never find contact information for. I never thought much about it until I moved there and happened to live right next door. It was strange because there was no hospital there.</p>

<p>For the next year and a half I tried everything I could to get that location unlisted as a hospital. I reported the problem multiple times as a user, I joined their map group and submitted the change manually, and I emailed the Google maps peoples repeatedly. Attempt after attempt was rejected. To this day the location is listed as a hospital with a pink background and a giant <code>H</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Photo_Sep_20,_3_42_04_PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>THERE IS NO HOSPITAL THERE.</strong></p>

<p>You can see the same <a href="https://maps.google.com/?ll=36.142896,-86.816781&amp;spn=0.002876,0.003964&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all" title="problem on the non-mobile version">problem on the non-mobile version</a>. <strong>Update 1.15.2013: This has been fixed.</strong></p>

<p>Even more amusing, if you look at the location in Google Maps and enable photos, you’ll see a photo I took of the building’s sign. It’s clearly an office building and not a hospital.</p>

<p>Apple Maps does not list a hospital at this location.</p>
