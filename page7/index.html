<p>Below is the pop up window that Nextgen shows when you are documenting the length of an office visit for billing purposes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Notice how the units of time are not labeled.<sup id="fnref:120830155506"><a href="#fn:120830155506" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Notice how you are given the option of documenting office visits to the fraction of a minute. I don’t think that even lawyers are greedy enough to charge for 0.25 of a minute.</li>
  <li>Notice the plus sign and minus sign. I’m still not sure what these are for. They are not for doing simple addition and subtraction. Hitting those changes the number to either positive or negative. Can you bill for negative minutes?</li>
  <li>Notice the options for 200-700 minute visits. Does anyone ever really see a patient in an outpatient clinic for 11 straight hours?</li>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2012/08/05/pasting-text-into-Epic.html">Errors when pasting text from a Mac into Epic and Allscripts</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><strong>Update 2 (5.23.2013):</strong> When my friend updated to Keyboard Maestro 6, this fix stopped working. This may be because the filter line endings had nothing to do with the fix, rather that process had an unexpected side effect of changing rich text to plain text. We are in the process of testing this theory. If you can’t wait, try filtering with “remove styles”.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/psufka">@psufka</a> reports that he has seen this with Windows machines, so apparently is not an isolated Mac compatibility issue.</p>

<p>A colleague  and friend was having trouble with the Epic electronic medical record. He writes his notes in Pages on the Mac and when he would try to paste the text into Epic, it would mess up. What he was seeing was his note was losing words and the paragraph formatting was screwed up. It was making his life painful, slow, and frustrating…basically like all EMRs make life.</p>

<p><strong>Thankfully, there’s a really simple solution</strong></p>

<p>What was happening (I think) was that he was pasting text from a Mac environment into a Unix environment, <a href="http://www.editpadpro.com/tricklinebreak.html">which have different (invisible) characters to end a line</a>.<sup id="fnref:1208051113"><a href="#fn:1208051113" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> has a function to change the line endings of whatever text is in the clipboard. So now, he copies the text to the clipboard using ⌘-C, switches to the EMR, and ⌃⌘-V pastes the correctly formatted text into the EMR without any screw ups.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pastingIntoEpic.png" alt="Epic pasting KM macro" /> </p>

<p>The same thing was also happening with another EMR he uses, Allscripts. The same solution worked there too.</p>

<p>Keyboard Maestro is a very powerful application for the Mac. I can’t begin to say how great it is. It is also not for beginners. If you’re looking to get started with taking more control over your machine, this is not the place I’d recommend starting unless you have a strong familiarity with computers and have someone to help you along the way. Otherwise, it’s very much worth it’s price of $36.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

  <p>Boom. Give that a nice abbreviation, like ;furl for “front URL,” and it’ll insert the URL directly where you’re typing. There’s no need to run the script and then paste the URL—that’s an inefficiency that comes from thinking the script has to act like you would.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve found this works better in Keyboard Maestro because I’m typically tying in urls right after another character, like a “(“. TextExpander won’t expand a macro in such a situation whereas Keyboard Maestro will. Just have the macro run an Applescript and paste the results.</p>

<p>For Safari: <code>tell application "Safari" to get the URL of the front document</code></p>

<p>For Chrome: <code>tell application "Google Chrome" to get the URL of active tab of first window</code></p>
