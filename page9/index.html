      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2012/01/27/email-to-my-friends.html">Email to my friends</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I want you to learn two things from this email. The first (the fish) is how to combine multiple open Safari windows into one window with multiple tabs. The second (how to fish) is about becoming self-sufficient and making your life better.</p>

<h3 id="the-fish">The Fish</h3>

<p>Safari has an option to “Merge All Windows”. On the menu bar go to Window &gt; Merge All Windows. Simple.</p>

<p>Even better, you can create a shortcut for this.</p>

<p>Open System Preferences (command-spacebar, type “System”), click on Keyboard, choose Keyboard Shortcuts, choose Application Shortcuts, click the “+” button. Under Application: choose Safari. Under Menu title: Type “Merge All Windows”. Under Keyboard Shortcut: press shift + option + command + m. Click add.</p>

<p>Now, whenever you have a bunch of Safari windows open, just hit shift + option + command + m. (It’s a lot easier than it sounds.)</p>

<h3 id="how-to-fish">How to fish</h3>

<p>I always end up with a million browser windows open, each with several open tabs in them. Frequently, they have the same mail, calendar, Google reader and log in to my EMR websites pulled up on them. Typically this happens when I click on a link in the first window and it opens the link in a new browser window, then later, with that window on top, I want my email and open a new tab to go to it, even though the same site is open in a different window that’s hidden. </p>

<p>I thought two things: windows should always open in a new tab and there should be a way to easily merge all these windows together. <em>I wish I could say that I immediately Google’d it and figured it out.</em> Unfortunately, I’ve been thinking about this for months and never bothered to do anything about it. This has happened to me more times than is healthy. I need to just learn that when I have a problem, there’s probably a solution already created.</p>

<p>For the first step, go to the menu bar: Safari &gt; Preferences &gt; Tabs. Under “Open pages in tabs instead of windows:” choose automatically. For the second step, I explained the second part above.</p>

<p><strong>Moral</strong>: There is almost always an easy way to do something on a Mac. If you want to do something, Google for how to do it.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, if you’re not using <a href="http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> for text macros, you deserve to check it out.</p>

<p>For the next 15 days it’s being <a href="http://www.productivemacs.com/f/75354">sold in a bundle</a> with 7 other Mac apps for five dollars less than it’s normal price ($30). You also get a bunch of other great productivity and social apps like Keyboard Maestro. </p>

<p>If you want to be a power user, or you have to because you use computers for a living, i.e. physician, than you need good macro programs.</p>

<p>Don’t know why? Make all your disease information, frequent prescriptions and operative notes/instructions into macros. It’s a lot easier to type OA and have all my osteoarthritis information pop up than to type it fresh each time or even copy and paste it.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2006/08/11/why-windows-sucks.html">Why I Hate Windows</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I love macs.  Sadly, I use Windows the most.  This is because 1) my mac died, 2) I won an HP laptop in a contest, 3) I’m too poor to buy a computer (or even pay the $500 I’m told it will cost to fix my ibook) and 4) all the hospitals I work at use win boxes.  The following is a story of my hell and something that would NEVER happen on a mac.</p>

<p>About a week ago my laptop became infected with a virus or two hundred when I visited a website.  I know this because google warned me it might contain malware and I went there anyway and as soon as I did my practically worthless virus program (Sophos) started screaming about infected files, but was unable to DO anything about it.  Meanwhile all sorts of pop ups, adware, and internet explorer toolbars started ravaging my system.</p>

<p>I installed a few other programs that were able to find and delete most of them, but the pop ups continued, more files continued to be infected, crashes became status quo and I wanted to smash the laptop with a hammer.  I had done everything I could to halt the damage, even trying system restore, which kept failing to restore, without success.  Finally today, on my day off, I reformatted the HD and reloaded everything.  Actually, I’m still reloading everything.</p>

<p>Thankfully, all my music was on my iPod, so I can port that back over (illegally?) and all of my pictures, documents etc. are also saved on usb drives.  I did lose some videos and am wasting hours redownloaded, installing and configuring my software.</p>

<p>Viruses suck.  Virus makers should die.  Windows sucks for being so vulnerable or popular.  You pick.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2006/05/30/iBook-RIP.html">iBook - RIP</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>My iBook first died a few months ago.  The screen stopped working and I figured it was DOA.  I finally decided to take it into a repair shop today.  They can fix it but it will cost $500USD.  Thus it is going to remain dead.  I could buy a new Gateway laptop with much better specs for $150 more.  As much as I love my macs this poor doc can’t afford that kind of expense.</p>

<p>Excuse me.  I need a moment to mourn.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/2006/05/09/pain-in-the-mouth.html">Pain in the mouth</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>A couple weeks ago I developed an abscess in the root of one of my top molars.  I had the whole swelling, tenderness and pain thing.  I felt like dying or ripping the thing out by the roots, either of which would have treated the problem.  Instead I wasted $50 seeing an “emergency dentist” who told me it was infected and needed to be drilled or removed.  Well, no shit sherlock.  I’m a fucking doctor–I know that.  Then he gave me heavy duty narcotic pain meds and an antibiotic, which isn’t exactly recommended by the dental societies.  </p>

<p>The key point is that it is very unlikely for the infection to go away without physically removing it via root canal or tooth removal and I have no money for either.  So, I’m trying to hold the bacteria at bay with antibiotics and asprin until my insurance at @ new job kicks in.  </p>

<p>Things had actually gotten better for awhile.  The swelling, pain, sensitivity and looseness subsided.  </p>

<p>And came back yesterday.  I think I’ll end up losing the tooth if I wait on this, but I have no money.  So while I see patients who never pay, I myself can’t get the medical care I need for lack of money.  Isn’t it ironic, don’t you think?</p>

<p>At least if I ever get accused of not understanding what it is like to be poor or to go without medical case, I can laugh like the devil by the pale moon light.</p>

      <div class="content"><p>I have a new phone, the Samsung A900, or Blade.  </p>

<p>Actually, the phone is great.  I’ve had her about 5 months.  At first she was buggy with sluggish menus and needing to be reset everytime I wanted to use picturemail, but a few firmware updates later and she purrs.  Using Opera’s browser (the built-in one sucks), I can browse my favorite sites and check (and reply) to my gmail.  The megapixel camera is good for taking printable portraits and still-lifes, but being camphone, don’t hope for anything in motion or wining any contests.  She can connect to your computer using USB or bluetooth and you can put (and use) almost any files on her that way, including mp3 and pdf.  This also means you can create your own ringtones without paying the companies their extortion fees.  She comes with bluetooth that is fully functional, except for A2DP.  You can even program her to type text messages as you talk to her: voice-to-text.  I use her for flickr, blogging and surfing the internet, especially during long, boring medical lectures.</p>
