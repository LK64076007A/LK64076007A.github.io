      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/do-not-suffer-bad-emrs">We should not suffer bad EMRs</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2012/08/suffer-growing-pains-electronic-health-records.html" title="Dr. Richard Just clearly lays out">Dr. Richard Just clearly lays out</a> a few of the problems that physicians are having with EMRs, but his apparent conclusion and the conclusion of the headline of the article are wrong.</p>

<p>He appears to think that while the current offering of EMRs are poor, we need to “suffer” through them.</p>

<p>Quite the opposite is true in fact. We should not support companies that make harmful products because of the promise that one day they will be beneficial any more than we would give a patient an experimental drug on the promise that one day the company will figure out a different drug that works.</p>

<p>False dichotomies are frequently raised in the discussion of EMRs. For example, unreadable handwritten progress notes are compared to legible electronic notes as an example of how EMR notes are better. However, we are all fully aware of the uselessness of many of the legible but copy-and-pasted notes<sup id="fnref:120822080308"><a href="#fn:120822080308" class="footnote">1</a></sup> in our medical era or the problems with notes “disappearing” as in Dr. Just’s example. The fallacy is that notes have to be either in a certified EMR or handwritten. </p>

<p>In my hospital, hand-written progress notes are still the norm, but when I round, I type my notes into my laptop, using lots of custom macros and scripts to aide in the process, and put the printed note into the chart. It’s certainly no Hitech, Cchit, MU EMR, but it is fast, reliable, secure, and legible. Even better, no note has ever magically disappeared because the vitals were not already entered. </p>

<p>As a nerd, programmer, and the one ultimately responsible for the safety of my patients, I declare that the EMRs I have been exposed to are unacceptable and at the same time that there are many electronic, technophilic ways to improve patient care.</p>

<p>I relish the day that I can purchase a quality EMR that makes my work better and my patient’s healthier. Until that time, I will not waste money supporting shit but will continue to make my own tools.</p>

<p>Supporting bad products, bad technology companies, and bad med-tech policies, regulations, and laws only delay, and hopefully not destroy, the time when we will one day have something worthy of our profession. Your patients deserve better.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/fixing-shortcuts-in-Messages">Fixing Shortcuts In Messages</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><strong><a href="/update-fixing-shortcuts-in-Messages">Click here for an updated version</a></strong></p>

<p>I like my keyboard shortcuts to be consistent across applications. Two shortcuts I use frequently ⌥-⌫ (option-delete) to erase the last word and ⌘-⌫ (command-delete) to erase the last line<sup id="fnref:1208062014"><a href="#fn:1208062014" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Since upgrading to Mountain Lion, every time I hit ⌘-⌫ in the Messages app, I get a prompt asking if I want to delete the conversation. And every single time it’s mentally jarring as normal, expected behavior elicits an unexpected and incorrect response. That shortcut is being used as a built-in for the app:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Built_in_messages_shortcut.png" alt="Wrong shortcut" /> </p>

<p>A few minutes of searching the web led me to the universally accepted answer that “no, there is nothing you can do about it.” Even a well written (I assume–tl;dr) <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/12/losers_weepers" title="Gruber">piece by Gruber</a> weren’t promising.</p>

<p>So I took a chance and tried to change the shortcut by adding another shortcut on top of it in Keyboard Shortcuts in system preferences. </p>

<p><img src="/images/changing_the_shortcut.png" alt="Changing the shortcut" /></p>

<p>I used ⌃⌥↩ because I can’t see myself every using that shortcut. I can’t explain why it seems to get duplicated and also show a new shortcut of ⌥⌘⌫. I did notice that when I went back and re-did this a few times (to take screenshots), I kept getting different duplications. One thing that seemed to be necessary is trying to first make the shortcut ⌃⌥⌫, which would make an error sound and not accept, then doing another one would lead to the desired results. </p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/pasting-text-into-Epic">Errors when pasting text from a Mac into Epic and Allscripts</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p><strong>Update 2 (5.23.2013):</strong> When my friend updated to Keyboard Maestro 6, this fix stopped working. This may be because the filter line endings had nothing to do with the fix, rather that process had an unexpected side effect of changing rich text to plain text. We are in the process of testing this theory. If you can’t wait, try filtering with “remove styles”.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://twitter.com/psufka">@psufka</a> reports that he has seen this with Windows machines, so apparently is not an isolated Mac compatibility issue.</p>

<p>A colleague  and friend was having trouble with the Epic electronic medical record. He writes his notes in Pages on the Mac and when he would try to paste the text into Epic, it would mess up. What he was seeing was his note was losing words and the paragraph formatting was screwed up. It was making his life painful, slow, and frustrating…basically like all EMRs make life.</p>

<p><strong>Thankfully, there’s a really simple solution</strong></p>

<p>What was happening (I think) was that he was pasting text from a Mac environment into a Unix environment, <a href="http://www.editpadpro.com/tricklinebreak.html">which have different (invisible) characters to end a line</a>.<sup id="fnref:1208051113"><a href="#fn:1208051113" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> has a function to change the line endings of whatever text is in the clipboard. So now, he copies the text to the clipboard using ⌘-C, switches to the EMR, and ⌃⌘-V pastes the correctly formatted text into the EMR without any screw ups.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pastingIntoEpic.png" alt="Epic pasting KM macro" /> </p>

<p>The same thing was also happening with another EMR he uses, Allscripts. The same solution worked there too.</p>

<p>Keyboard Maestro is a very powerful application for the Mac. I can’t begin to say how great it is. It is also not for beginners. If you’re looking to get started with taking more control over your machine, this is not the place I’d recommend starting unless you have a strong familiarity with computers and have someone to help you along the way. Otherwise, it’s very much worth it’s price of $36.</p>

  <p>Boom. Give that a nice abbreviation, like ;furl for “front URL,” and it’ll insert the URL directly where you’re typing. There’s no need to run the script and then paste the URL—that’s an inefficiency that comes from thinking the script has to act like you would.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I’ve found this works better in Keyboard Maestro because I’m typically tying in urls right after another character, like a “(“. TextExpander won’t expand a macro in such a situation whereas Keyboard Maestro will. Just have the macro run an Applescript and paste the results.</p>

<p>For Safari: <code>tell application "Safari" to get the URL of the front document</code></p>
