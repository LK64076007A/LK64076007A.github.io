      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/quitting-ascension">It's not me, it's you.</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I received a piece of mail today that I found insulting: my employer has hired an outside agency to determine if my son is my son.</p>

<p>Actually and technically, since my wife and I both work in the same company and the insurance is in her name, the letter was to my wife and was to verify that I am her husband and that our son is ours.</p>

<p>Riddled with corporate speak, this letter basically says that they don’t trust that everyone listed as a dependent–myself and my son–on my wife’s insurance is actually a dependent and that they want to make sure they aren’t paying for what they don’t have to be. Apparently, this is a company-wide initiative.</p>

<p>While I have no problem with companies verifying that there is no fraud occurring in their organization, I have multiple reasons to be upset with this letter.</p>

<p>First, in order to verify our status, this third party organization that I am not associated with in any way is demanding a copy of my marriage license, tax return with both our names on it, and my son’s birth certificate. If I don’t provide it to them in 2 weeks, we’ll lose our health insurance.</p>

<p>I’m not a low level corporate stooge. My wife and I were professionally recruited to this organization. We were interviewed by CEOs and COOs. The in-house recruiter helped find a school for my son. I have meetings regularly with my office manager, the regional manager, and the COO. The idea that this small family, 2/3’s of whom are salaried employees of the company, cannot be locally verified is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Also, there’s no reason that every employee shouldn’t be granted the same respect and it would not be difficult to do as I’ll explain later. </p>

<p>Second, our organization is infested with managers. It would take very little effort to have us present the same documentation to our local managers, who could feed this up the food chain. It’s the same way they verify we all get our yearly flu shots or have maintained our licenses. This way, the private information remains local and within the organization I work for and the money that the organization is paying out would be saved. At a time when the organization is performing mass lay offs and crying about how they are losing money, I cannot believe they are wasting money like this.</p>

<p>Finally, given the nature of my work, I cannot just quit if I don’t like the policy. I must give 6 months notice of termination. So, if I don’t give them this information, at the best, I would give up my employee health insurance, which is a part of my compensation package. I’m not sure if this would qualify as breach of contract on their part, and I don’t want to be a trouble maker and fight to find out. </p>

<p>What I do know: my resignation letter will be on my manager’s desk Monday morning. </p>

<p>Sadly, that will not be because of a sudden, principled stand against this issue. Less dramatically, I’ve been contemplating leaving for some time due to other issues like this.</p>

<p>I am taking this as a lesson for when I am the boss and hopefully treat my employees with more respect.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/PDF-Expert-for-iPhone">PDF Expert for iPhone - attention to detail</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>PDF Expert for iPhone is a great app, and for today is free. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">Get it</a>.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>I’m a big fan of the iOS development company <a href="http://readdle.com/products/">Readdle</a> because I use their apps constantly in my personal and work life. <a href="http://readdle.com/products/">Their apps</a> are beautiful, consistently updated, and insanely good. I’ve also bought other company’s competing apps but due to various problems, I stick with Readdle and both PDF Expert and Scanner Pro are have long-standing positions on my home screen.</p>

<p><img src="/images/PDFExpertForiPhone.png" alt="" height="568" width="320" /></p>

<p>I have used PDF Expert on my iPhone and iPad to study for boards, read journal articles, and complete applications for medical licensure, hospital privileges, condo rental, and private school for my son.</p>

<p>Today, in honor of Black Friday, they’ve dramatically cut the prices on their apps, including making <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert for the iPhone free</a>. Personally, I just bought PDF Converter.<sup id="fnref:121123135732"><a href="#fn:121123135732" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There is way too much to talk about with regards to how great some of their apps are, and I have several blog posts planned to discuss how I use some of their apps in my workflow, but I do want to share one small aspect of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert</a> that demonstrates the attention to detail in these apps.</p>

<p>I read a lot of science articles that are in 2 column PDF format. On the iPhone, and even the iPad sometimes, the screen is too small to read more than a single column at a time. A lot of PDF readers screw up the scrolling when going from the end of one page to the beginning of the next. Most of the time, when you are zoomed in on the bottom right corner of the page, when you scroll to the next page, you are either looking at the top right corner of the next page (if scrolling to the next page vertically), or the bottom left (if scrolling horizontally). <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/pdf-expert-professional-pdf/id323133888?mt=8">PDF Expert</a> gets it right by going right to the next text you’ll be wanting to read at the top left of the page in either vertical or horizontal scrolling. </p>

<p>This is better understood with a picture:</p>

<p><a href="/images/PDF%20expert%20screen%20scroll.gif"><img src="/images/PDF_expert_screen_scroll.gif" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Two other top apps for reading PDFs in my field are <a href="http://www.mekentosj.com/papers/">Papers</a> and <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/PDFpen/iPhone/index.html">PDFpen</a> both of which have versions for the Mac, iPad, and iPhone. </p>

<p>Papers scrolls horizontally and goes to the bottom right of the next page–area 6 in the above image. While it is the top app for scientific article management, and I highly recommend using it, I don’t recommend using it for reading PDFs. </p>

<p>PDFpen’s behavior changes based if you’ve ever been on the page you’re scrolling to before. If you’ve never been there, it actually zooms out to look at the whole page. If you have been to that page before, it goes back to whatever zoom at whatever location you were at before. This inconsistent behavior is annoying. I would like it if it just zoomed to the whole page view and this was a preference you could toggle, but as it is, like most of the implementations of PDFpen, I find it unusable.<sup id="fnref:121123141713"><a href="#fn:121123141713" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So, if you need to read PDFs and even edit them, including signing documents and mailing them back, go get PDF Expert today.</p>

  <p>In the most commonly repeated complaint by patients, it is related how a person languished for months on a public waiting list for an appointment or procedure, but was seen within a week as a private patient.

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Saving-sequential-webpages-with-Keyboard-Maestro">Saving sequential webpages as PDFs with Keyboard Maestro</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>I needed to save as PDF a series of 80 webpages on a slow server on a password protected website. I could have sat there for an hour doing it manually, but since I wanted to get dressed and have a cup of coffee, I made a Keyboard Macro shortcut instead.</p>

<p><a href="/images/Saving_with_KM.png"><img src="/images/Saving_with_KM.png" alt="" /></a> </p>

<p>In order to use this macro, you need to set up a very useful shortcut for saving files to PDF. In the stock OS, you hit ⌘-P (Command-P) to bring up the print dialogue box and then in the bottom left hand corner of the pop up menu click the down arrow by PDF and choose save as PDF. <strong>A much faster way  to do this,</strong> is to create a system shortcut that allows you to hit ⌘-P twice to initiate the save as PDF action. I learned this from MacSparky and <a href="http://macsparky.com/2008/3/19/keyboard-shortcut-for-save-as-pdf-in-os-x.html" title="still go to his page every time to remember how to set it up">still go to his page every time to remember how to set it up</a>.</p>

<p>The first two steps are to set up some incrementing variables to allow the files to be named with sequential numbers. If the webpages you’re saving have unique names, this won’t be necessary, but for my case it was.<sup id="fnref:1210130817"><a href="#fn:1210130817" class="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>

<p>The rest of the code is in a repeat loop. Since I knew it was going to be exactly 80 repeats, it was easier to do it this way than a while, or if loop. </p>

<p>The first part of the real code is to initiate the save as command with ⌘-P twice.</p>

<p>Then the file name is entered with the last digit being placed by a variable that will increment by +1 with every new name. Since the saving dialog seemed to take awhile, I added a pause into the mix. Then ⌘-down arrow moves the whole webpage to the very bottom where the “next page” button is. Keyboard Maestro has a powerful function to find images on a webpage and then use that image. In this case, when it sees the image of the next button, it left clicks the mouse in the center of the button. </p>

<p>The pages are slow to load, so I have a pause in there until the screen contains the image of a circular arrow. This is the refresh button in Safari and only shows up once a page is loaded. It’s an easy hack to make sure the next page is loaded. </p>

<p>And then this cycle repeats itself until all the pages were saved. It worked perfectly.</p>

<p>I didn’t even have time to do my hair and finish my coffee.</p>

      <p>Setting the constant 1 to the variable i was probably unnecessary, but I was trying to get this done quickly, not elegantly.  <a href="#fnref:1210130817" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <h2><a class="post-link" href="/Google-Maps-Fail">Google Maps Fail</a></h2>
      
      <div class="content"><p>Bashing Apple’s maps is the thing to do these days, but I just want to share my own Google Maps story. </p>

<p>When I was looking to move to Nashville two years ago I started looking for jobs by looking at hospitals I found on Google maps. There was one hospital on the map that I could never find contact information for. I never thought much about it until I moved there and happened to live right next door. It was strange because there was no hospital there.</p>

<p>For the next year and a half I tried everything I could to get that location unlisted as a hospital. I reported the problem multiple times as a user, I joined their map group and submitted the change manually, and I emailed the Google maps peoples repeatedly. Attempt after attempt was rejected. To this day the location is listed as a hospital with a pink background and a giant <code>H</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/GoogleMapsHospitalFail.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>THERE IS NO HOSPITAL THERE.</strong></p>

<p>You can see the same <a href="https://maps.google.com/?ll=36.142896,-86.816781&amp;spn=0.002876,0.003964&amp;t=m&amp;z=18&amp;lci=com.panoramio.all" title="problem on the non-mobile version">problem on the non-mobile version</a>. <strong>Update 1.15.2013: This has been fixed.</strong></p>

<p>Even more amusing, if you look at the location in Google Maps and enable photos, you’ll see a photo I took of the building’s sign. It’s clearly an office building and not a hospital.</p>

<p>Apple Maps does not list a hospital at this location.</p>

      <div class="content"><h3 id="update">Update</h3>
<p>Make a new Keyboard Shortcut in the preferences menu so that “Close Conversation…” is ⌘-W. That will restore ⌘-⌫ to the correct “delete whole line functionality.”</p>

<h3 id="original--august-6-2012">Original  (August 6, 2012)</h3>
<p>I like my keyboard shortcuts to be consistent across applications. Two shortcuts I use frequently ⌥-⌫ (option-delete) to erase the last word and ⌘-⌫ (command-delete) to erase the last line<sup id="fnref:1208062014"><a href="#fn:1208062014" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Since upgrading to Mountain Lion, every time I hit ⌘-⌫ in the Messages app, I get a prompt asking if I want to delete the conversation. And every single time it’s mentally jarring as normal, expected behavior elicits an unexpected and incorrect response. That shortcut is being used as a built-in for the app:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Built_in_messages_shortcut.png" alt="Wrong shortcut" /> </p>

<p>A few minutes of searching the web led me to the universally accepted answer that “no, there is nothing you can do about it.” Even a well written (I assume–tl;dr) <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/12/losers_weepers">piece by Gruber</a> weren’t promising.</p>

<p>So I took a chance and tried to change the shortcut by adding another shortcut on top of it in Keyboard Shortcuts in system preferences. </p>

<p><img src="/images/changing_the_shortcut.png" alt="Changing the shortcut" /></p>

<p>I used ⌃⌥↩ because I can’t see myself every using that shortcut. I can’t explain why it seems to get duplicated and also show a new shortcut of ⌥⌘⌫. I did notice that when I went back and re-did this a few times (to take screenshots), I kept getting different duplications. One thing that seemed to be necessary is trying to first make the shortcut ⌃⌥⌫, which would make an error sound and not accept, then doing another one would lead to the desired results. </p>

<p>Clear as mud, I know. </p>
